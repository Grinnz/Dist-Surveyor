  CPAN::DistnameInfo - Extract distribution name and version from a distribution filename

    my $pathname = "authors/id/G/GB/GBARR/CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02.tar.gz";
  
    my $d = CPAN::DistnameInfo->new($pathname);
  
    my $dist      = $d->dist;      # "CPAN-DistnameInfo"
    my $version   = $d->version;   # "0.02"
    my $maturity  = $d->maturity;  # "released"
    my $filename  = $d->filename;  # "CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02.tar.gz"
    my $cpanid    = $d->cpanid;    # "GBARR"
    my $distvname = $d->distvname; # "CPAN-DistnameInfo-0.02"
    my $extension = $d->extension; # "tar.gz"
    my $pathname  = $d->pathname;  # "authors/id/G/GB/GBARR/..."
  
    my %prop = $d->properties;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to
  associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from
  the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as
  they have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
  distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
  uploads are created in this way.
  
  C<CPAN::DistnameInfo> uses heuristics that have been learnt by
  L<http://search.cpan.org/> to extract the distribution name and
  version from filenames and also report if the version is to be
  treated as a developer release
  
  The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the following methods
  
  =over
  
  =item cpanid
  
  If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the
  the CPAN id of the author.
  
  =item dist
  
  The name of the distribution
  
  =item distvname
  
  The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed
  
  =item filename
  
  If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the
  path to the file relative to the detected CPAN author directory. Otherwise it is the path
  that was passed in.
  
  =item maturity
  
  The maturity of the distribution. This will be either C<released> or C<developer>
  
  =item extension
  
  The extension of the distribution, often used to denote the archive type (e.g. 'tar.gz')
  
  =item pathname
  
  The pathname that was passed to the constructor when creating the object.
  
  =item properties
  
  This will return a list of key-value pairs, suitable for assigning to a hash,
  for the known properties.
  
  =item version
  
  The extracted version

      };
      my @installed_releases = determine_installed_releases($options, \@libdirs);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Surveys your huge ball of Perl modules, jammed together inside a directory,
  and tells you exactly which module is installed there.
  
  For quick start, and a fine example of this module usage, see L<dist_surveyor>.
  
  This module have one exported function - determine_installed_releases

  A regex qr//. If exists, will ignore modules that doesn't match this regex
  
  =item opt_perlver
  
  Skip modules that are included as core in this Perl version
  
  =item opt_remnants
  
  If true, output will include old distribution versions that have left old modules behind
  
  =item distro_key_mod_names
  
  A hash-ref, with a list of irregular named releases. i.e. 'libwww-perl' => 'LWP'.
  
  =back
  
  $search_dirs is an array-ref containing the list of directories to survey.
  
  Returns a list, where each element is a hashref representing one installed distibution.
  This hashref is what MetaCPAN returns for http://api.metacpan.org/v0/release/$author/$release,
  with two additional keys: 
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  'url' - that same as 'download_url', but without the hostname. can be used to
  download the file for your favorite mirror
  
  =item *
  
  'dist_data' - Hashref containing info about the release, i.e. percent_installed.
  (fully installed releases will have '100.00')

  Dist::Surveyor::MakeCpan - Create a Mini-CPAN for the surveyed modules
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Dist::Surveyor::MakeCpan;
      my $cpan = Dist::Surveyor::MakeCpan->new(
              $cpan_dir, $progname, $irregularities);
      foreach my $rel (@releases) {
          $cpan->add_release($rel);
      }
      $cpan->close();
      say "There where ", $cpan->errors(), " errors";
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Create a mini-CPAN for the surveyed modules, so you will be able to re-install 
  the same setup in a new computer.
  
  =head1 CONSTRUCTOR
  
      my $cpan = Dist::Surveyor::MakeCpan->new(
              $cpan_dir, $progname, $irregularities, $verbose);
  
  =over
  
  =item $cpan_dir
  
  The directory where the mini-cpan will be created
  
  =item $progname
  
  The name of the running program - will be used to create a subdirectory 
  inside $cpan_dir, that will contain debug information.
  
  =item $irregularities
  
  A hashref with a list of irregular named releases. i.e. 'libwww-perl' => 'LWP'.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 $cpan->add_release($rel)
  
  Add one release to the mini-cpan. the $rel should be a hashref, 
  and contain the following fields:
  
      $rel = {
          download_url => 'http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/S/SE/SEMUELF/Dist-Surveyor-0.009.tar.gz',
          url => 'authors/id/S/SE/SEMUELF/Dist-Surveyor-0.009.tar.gz',
          author => 'SEMUELF',
          name => 'Dist-Surveyor-0.009',
          distribution => 'Dist-Surveyor',
      }
  
  =head2 $cpan->close()
  
  Close the mini-CPAN, and close all the debug data dump files.

  =head1 VERSION
  
      2.90
  
  This version is compatible with JSON::XS B<2.34> and later.
  (Not yet compatble to JSON::XS B<3.0x>.)
  
  
  =head1 NOTE
  
  JSON::PP was earlier included in the C<JSON> distribution, but
  has since Perl 5.14 been a core module. For this reason,
  L<JSON::PP> was removed from the JSON distribution and can now
  be found also in the Perl5 repository at
  
  =over
  
  =item * L<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git>
  
  =back
  
  (The newest JSON::PP version still exists in CPAN.)
  
  Instead, the C<JSON> distribution will include JSON::backportPP
  for backwards computability. JSON.pm should thus work as it did
  before.

   *************************** CAUTION **************************************
   *                                                                        *
   * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE (JSON::XS version 2.90)                            *
   *                                                                        *
   * JSON.pm had patched JSON::XS::Boolean and JSON::PP::Boolean internally *
   * on loading time for making these modules inherit JSON::Boolean.        *
   * But since JSON::XS v3.0 it use Types::Serialiser as boolean class.     *
   * Then now JSON.pm breaks boolean classe overload features and           *
   * -support_by_pp if JSON::XS v3.0 or later is installed.                 *
   *                                                                        *
   * JSON::true and JSON::false returned JSON::Boolean objects.             *
   * For workaround, they return JSON::PP::Boolean objects in this version. *
   *                                                                        *

   * And it discards a feature:                                             *
   *                                                                        *

  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple data format.
  See to L<http://www.json.org/> and C<RFC4627>(L<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>).
  
  This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa using either
  L<JSON::XS> or L<JSON::PP>.
  
  JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN which must be
  compiled and installed in your environment.
  JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module which is bundled in this distribution and
  has a strong compatibility to JSON::XS.
  
  This module try to use JSON::XS by default and fail to it, use JSON::PP instead.
  So its features completely depend on JSON::XS or JSON::PP.
  
  See to L<BACKEND MODULE DECISION>.
  
  To distinguish the module name 'JSON' and the format type JSON,
  the former is quoted by CE<lt>E<gt> (its results vary with your using media),
  and the latter is left just as it is.
  
  Module name : C<JSON>
  
  Format type : JSON
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over
  
  =item * correct unicode handling
  
  This module (i.e. backend modules) knows how to handle Unicode, documents
  how and when it does so, and even documents what "correct" means.
  
  Even though there are limitations, this feature is available since Perl version 5.6.
  
  JSON::XS requires Perl 5.8.2 (but works correctly in 5.8.8 or later), so in older versions
  C<JSON> should call JSON::PP as the backend which can be used since Perl 5.005.
  
  With Perl 5.8.x JSON::PP works, but from 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, because of a Perl side problem,
  JSON::PP works slower in the versions. And in 5.005, the Unicode handling is not available.
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> for more information.
  
  See also to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>
  and L<JSON::XS/ENCODING/CODESET_FLAG_NOTES>.
  
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
  by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
  level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
  it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
  L</MAPPING> section below to learn about those.
  
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security
  feature).
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/FEATURES> and L<JSON::PP/FEATURES>.
  
  =item * fast
  
  This module returns a JSON::XS object itself if available.
  Compared to other JSON modules and other serialisers such as Storable,
  JSON::XS usually compares favorably in terms of speed, too.
  
  If not available, C<JSON> returns a JSON::PP object instead of JSON::XS and
  it is very slow as pure-Perl.
  
  =item * simple to use
  
  This module has both a simple functional interface as well as an
  object oriented interface interface.
  
  =item * reasonably versatile output formats
  
  You can choose between the most compact guaranteed-single-line format possible
  (nice for simple line-based protocols), a pure-ASCII format (for when your transport
  is not 8-bit clean, still supports the whole Unicode range), or a pretty-printed
  format (for when you want to read that stuff). Or you can combine those features
  in whatever way you like.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
  C<to_json> and C<from_json> are additional functions.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  
  =head2 to_json
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a json string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $json_text = JSON->new->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Takes a hash reference as the second.
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar, $flag_hashref)
  
  So,
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar, {utf8 => 1, pretty => 1})
  
  equivalent to:
  
     $json_text = JSON->new->utf8(1)->pretty(1)->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  If you want to write a modern perl code which communicates to outer world,
  you should use C<encode_json> (supposed that JSON data are encoded in UTF-8).
  
  =head2 from_json
  
     $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<to_json>: expects a json string and tries
  to parse it, returning the resulting reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->decode($json_text)
  
  Takes a hash reference as the second.
  
      $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text, $flag_hashref)
  
  So,
  
      $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text, {utf8 => 1})
  
  equivalent to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->new->utf8(1)->decode($json_text)
  
  If you want to write a modern perl code which communicates to outer world,
  you should use C<decode_json> (supposed that JSON data are encoded in UTF-8).
  
  =head2 JSON::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::true or
  JSON::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  =head2 JSON::true
  
  Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::false
  
  Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::null
  
  Returns C<undef>.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
  
  This section supposes that your perl version is 5.8 or later.
  
  If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
  is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
  with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
  
    # from network
    my $json        = JSON->new->utf8;
    my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
    my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
    
    # from file content
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    $json_text   = <$fh>;
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
  
  If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
  
    use Encode;
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    my $encoding = 'cp932';
    my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
    
    # or you can write the below code.
    #
    # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
    # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
  
  In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
  So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable or C<from_json>.
  
    $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
    # or
    $perl_scalar = from_json( $unicode_json_text );
  
  Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
    # this way is not efficient.
  
  And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
  send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
  
  Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
  in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  
    print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
    # or
    print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
  
  If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
  for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
  (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
  You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable or C<to_json>.
  Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
  
    # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
    $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
    # or 
    $unicode_json_text = to_json( $perl_scalar );
    # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
    print $unicode_json_text;
  
  Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
    # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
    $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
  
  This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
  
  See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
  
  
  =head1 COMMON OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON->new
  
  Returns a new C<JSON> object inherited from either JSON::XS or JSON::PP
  that can be used to de/encode JSON strings.
  
  All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
  the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
  a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
  required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
  
  This feature depends on the used Perl version and environment.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> if the backend is PP.
  
    JSON->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
  text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
  unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
    JSON->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
  into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
  an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
  characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
  
  In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
  encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
  Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
  (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::XS->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::XS->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> if the backend is PP.
  
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> (and in the future possibly more) flags in one call to
  generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Equivalent to:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after
  
  The indent space length is three and JSON::XS cannot change the indent
  space length.
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will use a multiline
  format as output, putting every array member or object/hash key-value pair
  into its own line, identifying them properly.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the
  resulting JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any C<newlines>.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  The indent space length is three.
  With JSON::PP, you can also access C<indent_length> to change indent space length.
  
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
     JSON->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
  Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
  separately by c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
  recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
  partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
  B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
  disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
  object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
  encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object.
  
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
  and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
  C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
  to do.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
  to do when a blessed object is found.
  
  =over
  
  =item convert_blessed_universally mode
  
  If use C<JSON> with C<-convert_blessed_universally>, the C<UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON>
  subroutine is defined as the below code:
  
     *UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON = sub {
         my $b_obj = B::svref_2object( $_[0] );
         return    $b_obj->isa('B::HV') ? { %{ $_[0] } }
                 : $b_obj->isa('B::AV') ? [ @{ $_[0] } ]
                 : undef
                 ;
     }
  
  This will cause that C<encode> method converts simple blessed objects into
  JSON objects as non-blessed object.
  
     JSON -convert_blessed_universally;
     $json->allow_blessed->convert_blessed->encode( $blessed_object )
  
  This feature is experimental and may be removed in the future.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
  a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
  (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
  deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
  (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
  hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  With JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible. This can save
  memory when your JSON texts are either very very long or you have many
  short strings. It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form
  if possible: perl stores strings internally either in an encoding called
  UTF-X or in octet-form. The latter cannot store everything but uses less
  space in general (and some buggy Perl or C code might even rely on that
  internal representation being used).
  
  With JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
  C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>. See to L<utf8>.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE> and L<JSON::PP/METHODS>.
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  Note that nesting is implemented by recursion in C. The default value has
  been chosen to be as large as typical operating systems allow without
  crashing. (JSON::XS)
  
  With JSON::PP as the backend, when a large value (100 or more) was set and
  it de/encodes a deep nested object/text, it may raise a warning
  'Deep recursion on subroutine' at the perl runtime phase.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
  to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
  converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
  become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
  Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
  References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
  Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
  C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
  C<null> becomes C<undef>.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
     JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([], 3)
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
  
  =head2 property
  
      $boolean = $json->property($property_name)
  
  Returns a boolean value about above some properties.
  
  The available properties are C<ascii>, C<latin1>, C<utf8>,
  C<indent>,C<space_before>, C<space_after>, C<relaxed>, C<canonical>,
  C<allow_nonref>, C<allow_unknown>, C<allow_blessed>, C<convert_blessed>,
  C<shrink>, C<max_depth> and C<max_size>.
  
     $boolean = $json->property('utf8');
      => 0
     $json->utf8;
     $boolean = $json->property('utf8');
      => 1
  
  Sets the property with a given boolean value.
  
      $json = $json->property($property_name => $boolean);
  
  With no argument, it returns all the above properties as a hash reference.
  
      $flag_hashref = $json->property();
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
  This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
  It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
  it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
  to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
  (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
  
  The backend module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthesis
  mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
  
      my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
      $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
  
  In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
  You must write codes like the below:
  
      $string = $json->incr_text;
      $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
      $json->incr_text( $string );
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
  parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
  died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
  unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
  
  
  =head1 JSON::PP SUPPORT METHODS
  
  The below methods are JSON::PP own methods, so when C<JSON> works
  with JSON::PP (i.e. the created object is a JSON::PP object), available.
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS> in detail.
  
  If you use C<JSON> with additional C<-support_by_pp>, some methods
  are available even with JSON::XS. See to L<USE PP FEATURES EVEN THOUGH XS BACKEND>.
  
     BEING { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 'JSON::XS' }
     
     use JSON -support_by_pp;
     
     my $json = JSON->new;
     $json->allow_nonref->escape_slash->encode("/");
  
     # functional interfaces too.
     print to_json(["/"], {escape_slash => 1});
     print from_json('["foo"]', {utf8 => 1});
  
  If you do not want to all functions but C<-support_by_pp>,
  use C<-no_export>.
  
     use JSON -support_by_pp, -no_export;
     # functional interfaces are not exported.
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  any JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
  format.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
  object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  On the contrary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See to L<MAPPING> about the conversion of JSON number.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
  
  The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
  and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
  unescaped strings.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
  
  According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But by default
  JSON backend modules encode strings without escaping slash.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($length)
  
  With JSON::XS, The indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
  With JSON::PP, it sets the indent space length with the given $length.
  The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
  
  If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used.
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
  
  As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
  subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
  with 'JSON::PP::'.
  
  If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON>.
  JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  If the backend is JSON::PP and C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
  and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
  L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::true> and C<JSON::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
  
     print JSON::true + 1;
      => 1
  
     ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
     ok(JSON::true == 1);
  
  C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
  
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  C<JSON::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
  in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
  pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
  stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
  optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
  the same data structure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
  settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
  and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
  against another for equality.
  
  In future, the ordered object feature will be added to JSON::PP using C<tie> mechanism.
  
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
  
     to_json [\0,JSON::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::true, JSON::false, JSON::null
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  JSON::null returns C<undef>.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
  C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
  how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
  exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
  your own serialiser method.
  
  With C<convert_blessed_universally> mode,  C<encode> converts blessed
  hash references or blessed array references (contains other blessed references)
  into JSON members and arrays.
  
     use JSON -convert_blessed_universally;
     JSON->new->allow_blessed->convert_blessed->encode( $blessed_object );
  
  See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =item Big Number
  
  If the backend is JSON::PP and C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
  C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.
  
  
  =back
  
  =head1 JSON and ECMAscript
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/JSON and ECMAscript>.
  
  =head1 JSON and YAML
  
  JSON is not a subset of YAML.
  See to L<JSON::XS/JSON and YAML>.
  
  
  =head1 BACKEND MODULE DECISION
  
  When you use C<JSON>, C<JSON> tries to C<use> JSON::XS. If this call failed, it will
  C<uses> JSON::PP. The required JSON::XS version is I<2.2> or later.
  
  The C<JSON> constructor method returns an object inherited from the backend module,
  and JSON::XS object is a blessed scalar reference while JSON::PP is a blessed hash
  reference.
  
  So, your program should not depend on the backend module, especially
  returned objects should not be modified.
  
   my $json = JSON->new; # XS or PP?
   $json->{stash} = 'this is xs object'; # this code may raise an error!
  
  To check the backend module, there are some methods - C<backend>, C<is_pp> and C<is_xs>.
  
    JSON->backend; # 'JSON::XS' or 'JSON::PP'
    
    JSON->backend->is_pp: # 0 or 1
    
    JSON->backend->is_xs: # 1 or 0
    
    $json->is_xs; # 1 or 0
    
    $json->is_pp; # 0 or 1
  
  
  If you set an environment variable C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND>, the calling action will be changed.
  
  =over
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 0 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::PP'
  
  Always use JSON::PP
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND == 1 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::XS,JSON::PP'
  
  (The default) Use compiled JSON::XS if it is properly compiled & installed,
  otherwise use JSON::PP.
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND == 2 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::XS'
  
  Always use compiled JSON::XS, die if it isn't properly compiled & installed.
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::backportPP'
  
  Always use JSON::backportPP.
  JSON::backportPP is JSON::PP back port module.
  C<JSON> includes JSON::backportPP instead of JSON::PP.
  
  =back
  
  These ideas come from L<DBI::PurePerl> mechanism.
  
  example:
  
   BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 'JSON::PP' }
   use JSON; # always uses JSON::PP
  
  In future, it may be able to specify another module.
  
  =head1 USE PP FEATURES EVEN THOUGH XS BACKEND
  
  Many methods are available with either JSON::XS or JSON::PP and
  when the backend module is JSON::XS, if any JSON::PP specific (i.e. JSON::XS unsupported)
  method is called, it will C<warn> and be noop.
  
  But If you C<use> C<JSON> passing the optional string C<-support_by_pp>,
  it makes a part of those unsupported methods available.
  This feature is achieved by using JSON::PP in C<de/encode>.
  
     BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 2 } # with JSON::XS
     use JSON -support_by_pp;
     my $json = JSON->new;
     $json->allow_nonref->escape_slash->encode("/");
  
  At this time, the returned object is a C<JSON::Backend::XS::Supportable>
  object (re-blessed XS object), and  by checking JSON::XS unsupported flags
  in de/encoding, can support some unsupported methods - C<loose>, C<allow_bignum>,
  C<allow_barekey>, C<allow_singlequote>, C<escape_slash> and C<indent_length>.
  
  When any unsupported methods are not enable, C<XS de/encode> will be
  used as is. The switch is achieved by changing the symbolic tables.
  
  C<-support_by_pp> is effective only when the backend module is JSON::XS
  and it makes the de/encoding speed down a bit.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP SUPPORT METHODS>.
  
  =head1 INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES TO OLD VERSION
  
  There are big incompatibility between new version (2.00) and old (1.xx).
  If you use old C<JSON> 1.xx in your code, please check it.
  
  See to L<Transition ways from 1.xx to 2.xx.>
  
  =over
  
  =item jsonToObj and objToJson are obsoleted.
  
  Non Perl-style name C<jsonToObj> and C<objToJson> are obsoleted
  (but not yet deleted from the source).
  If you use these functions in your code, please replace them
  with C<from_json> and C<to_json>.
  
  
  =item Global variables are no longer available.
  
  C<JSON> class variables - C<$JSON::AUTOCONVERT>, C<$JSON::BareKey>, etc...
  - are not available any longer.
  Instead, various features can be used through object methods.
  
  
  =item Package JSON::Converter and JSON::Parser are deleted.
  
  Now C<JSON> bundles with JSON::PP which can handle JSON more properly than them.
  
  =item Package JSON::NotString is deleted.
  
  There was C<JSON::NotString> class which represents JSON value C<true>, C<false>, C<null>
  and numbers. It was deleted and replaced by C<JSON::Boolean>.
  
  C<JSON::Boolean> represents C<true> and C<false>.
  
  C<JSON::Boolean> does not represent C<null>.
  
  C<JSON::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  C<JSON> makes L<JSON::XS::Boolean> and L<JSON::PP::Boolean> is-a relation
  to L<JSON::Boolean>.
  
  =item function JSON::Number is obsoleted.
  
  C<JSON::Number> is now needless because JSON::XS and JSON::PP have
  round-trip integrity.
  
  =item JSONRPC modules are deleted.
  
  Perl implementation of JSON-RPC protocol - C<JSONRPC >, C<JSONRPC::Transport::HTTP>
  and C<Apache::JSONRPC > are deleted in this distribution.
  Instead of them, there is L<JSON::RPC> which supports JSON-RPC protocol version 1.1.

  In conclusion:

  See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
  
  =item $JSON::UnMapping
  
  Disable. See to L<MAPPING>.
  
  =item $JSON::SelfConvert
  
  This option was deleted.
  Instead of it, if a given blessed object has the C<TO_JSON> method,
  C<TO_JSON> will be executed with C<convert_blessed>.
  
    $json->convert_blessed->encode($blessed_hashref_or_arrayref)
    # if need, call allow_blessed
  
  Note that it was C<toJson> in old version, but now not C<toJson> but C<TO_JSON>.

  =head1 VERSION
  
      2.27200
  
  L<JSON::XS> 2.27 (~2.30) compatible.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is L<JSON::XS> compatible pure Perl module.
  (Perl 5.8 or later is recommended)
  
  JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN.
  It is written by Marc Lehmann in C, so must be compiled and
  installed in the used environment.
  
  JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module and has compatibility to JSON::XS.
  
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over
  
  =item * correct unicode handling
  
  This module knows how to handle Unicode (depending on Perl version).
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL> and
  L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types
  supported by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is
  identical on the Perl level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly
  become "2" just because it looks like a number). There I<are> minor
  exceptions to this, read the MAPPING section below to learn about
  those.
  
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a
  security feature). But when some options are set, loose checking
  features are available.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON::PP->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON::PP->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::PP::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::PP::true or
  JSON::PP::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::true
  
  Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::false
  
  Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::null
  
  Returns C<undef>.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  
  =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
  
  This section supposes that your perl version is 5.8 or later.
  
  If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
  is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
  with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
  
    # from network
    my $json        = JSON::PP->new->utf8;
    my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
    my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
    
    # from file content
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    $json_text   = <$fh>;
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
  
  If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
  
    use Encode;
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    my $encoding = 'cp932';
    my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
    
    # or you can write the below code.
    #
    # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
    # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
  
  In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
  So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  
    $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
  
  Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
    # this way is not efficient.
  
  And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
  send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
  
  Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
  in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  
    print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
    # or
    print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
  
  If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
  for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
  (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
  You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
  
    # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
    $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
    # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
    print $unicode_json_text;
  
  Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
    # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
    $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
  
  This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
  
  See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
  
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  Basically, check to L<JSON> or L<JSON::XS>.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON::PP->new
  
  Returns a new JSON::PP object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings.
  
  All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::PP->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
  the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
  a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
  (See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>).
  
  In Perl 5.005, there is no character having high value (more than 255).
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
  required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
  
    JSON::PP->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
  text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
  unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
    JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
  into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
  an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
  characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
  
  (In Perl 5.005, any character outside the range 0..255 does not exist.
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.)
  
  In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
  encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
  Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
  (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::PP->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::PP->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> flags in one call to generate the most readable
  (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Equivalent to:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  The default indent space length is three.
  You can use C<indent_length> to change the length.
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  If you want your own sorting routine, you can give a code reference
  or a subroutine name to C<sort_by>. See to C<JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
     JSON::PP->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
  Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
  separately by c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
  recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
  partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
  B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
  disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
  object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
  encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object.
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
  and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
  C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
  to do.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
  to do when a blessed object is found.
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
  a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
  (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
  deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
  (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
  hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::PP->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::PP
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  In JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible.
  It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form if possible.
  
  In JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
  C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>.
  See to L<utf8>.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  When a large value (100 or more) was set and it de/encodes a deep nested object/text,
  it may raise a warning 'Deep recursion on subroutine' at the perl runtime phase.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
  to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
  converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
  become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
  Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
  References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
  Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
  C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
  C<null> becomes C<undef>.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
     JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([], 3)
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
  This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
  It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
  it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
  to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
  (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
  
  This module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthesis
  mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
  
      my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
      $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
  
  In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
  You must write codes like the below:
  
      $string = $json->incr_text;
      $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
      $json->incr_text( $string );
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
  parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
  died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
  unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
  
  
  =head1 JSON::PP OWN METHODS
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
  format.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
  object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  On the contrary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING> about the normal conversion of JSON number.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
  
  The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
  and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
  unescaped strings.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>.
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
  
  According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But default
  JSON::PP (as same as JSON::XS) encodes strings without escaping slash.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($length)
  
  JSON::XS indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
  JSON::PP set the indent space length with the given $length.
  The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
  
  If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used
  in encoding JSON objects.
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
  
  As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
  subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
  'JSON::PP::'.
  
  If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.

  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON::PP>.
  JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
  and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
  L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::PP::true> and C<JSON::PP::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
  
     print JSON::PP::true . "\n";
      => true
     print JSON::PP::true + 1;
      => 1
  
     ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
     ok(JSON::true == 1);
  
  C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
  
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  C<JSON::PP::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
  in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
  pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
  stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
  optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
  the same data structure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
  settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
  and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
  against another for equality.
  
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
  
     to_json [\0,JSON::PP::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::PP::true, JSON::PP::false, JSON::PP::null
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  JSON::PP::null returns C<undef>.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
  C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
  how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
  exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
  your own serialiser method.
  
  See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =item Big Number
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
  C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.
  
  
  =back
  
  =head1 UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS
  
  If you do not know about Unicode on Perl well,
  please check L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.8 and later
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work properly.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345);
  
  Returns C<"\u3042"> and C<"\ud808\udf45"> respectively.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\u3042"');
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  Returns UTF-8 encoded strings with UTF8 flag, regarded as C<U+3042> and C<U+12345>.
  
  Note that the versions from Perl 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, Perl built-in C<join> was broken,
  so JSON::PP wraps the C<join> with a subroutine. Thus JSON::PP works slow in the versions.
  
  
  =head2 Perl 5.6
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.005
  
  Perl 5.005 is a byte semantics world -- all strings are sequences of bytes.
  That means the unicode handling is not available.
  
  In encoding,
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);  # hex 3042 is 12354.
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345); # hex 12345 is 74565.
  
  Returns C<B> and C<E>, as C<chr> takes a value more than 255, it treats
  as C<$value % 256>, so the above codes are equivalent to :
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 66);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 69);
  
  In decoding,
  
      $json->decode('"\u00e3\u0081\u0082"');
  
  The returned is a byte sequence C<0xE3 0x81 0x82> for UTF-8 encoded
  japanese character (C<HIRAGANA LETTER A>).
  And if it is represented in Unicode code point, C<U+3042>.
  
  Next, 
  
      $json->decode('"\u3042"');
  
  We ordinary expect the returned value is a Unicode character C<U+3042>.
  But here is 5.005 world. This is C<0xE3 0x81 0x82>.
  
      $json->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  This is not a character C<U+12345> but bytes - C<0xf0 0x92 0x8d 0x85>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Types::Serialiser - simple data types for common serialisation formats
  
  =encoding utf-8
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
  serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a
  repository of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by
  different implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
  
  =cut
  
  package Types::Serialiser;
  
  use common::sense; # required to suppress annoying warnings
  
  our $VERSION = '1.0';
  
  =head1 SIMPLE SCALAR CONSTANTS
  
  Simple scalar constants are values that are overloaded to act like simple
  Perl values, but have (class) type to differentiate them from normal Perl
  scalars. This is necessary because these have different representations in
  the serialisation formats.
  
  =head2 BOOLEANS (Types::Serialiser::Boolean class)
  
  This type has only two instances, true and false. A natural representation
  for these in Perl is C<1> and C<0>, but serialisation formats need to be
  able to differentiate between them and mere numbers.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::true, Types::Serialiser::true
  
  This value represents the "true" value. In most contexts is acts like
  the number C<1>. It is up to you whether you use the variable form
  (C<$Types::Serialiser::true>) or the constant form (C<Types::Serialiser::true>).
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<1> -
  implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::false, Types::Serialiser::false
  
  This value represents the "false" value. In most contexts is acts like
  the number C<0>. It is up to you whether you use the variable form
  (C<$Types::Serialiser::false>) or the constant form (C<Types::Serialiser::false>).
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<0> -
  implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $is_bool = Types::Serialiser::is_bool $value
  
  Returns true iff the C<$value> is either C<$Types::Serialiser::true> or
  C<$Types::Serialiser::false>.
  
  For example, you could differentiate between a perl true value and a
  C<Types::Serialiser::true> by using this:
  
     $value && Types::Serialiser::is_bool $value
  
  =item $is_true = Types::Serialiser::is_true $value
  
  Returns true iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::true>.
  
  =item $is_false = Types::Serialiser::is_false $value
  
  Returns false iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::false>.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 ERROR (Types::Serialiser::Error class)
  
  This class has only a single instance, C<error>. It is used to signal
  an encoding or decoding error. In CBOR for example, and object that
  couldn't be encoded will be represented by a CBOR undefined value, which
  is represented by the error value in Perl.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::error, Types::Serialiser::error
  
  This value represents the "error" value. Accessing values of this type
  will throw an exception.
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<undef>
  - implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $is_error = Types::Serialiser::is_error $value
  
  Returns false iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::error>.

  =head1 NOTES FOR XS USERS
  
  The recommended way to detect whether a scalar is one of these objects
  is to check whether the stash is the C<Types::Serialiser::Boolean> or
  C<Types::Serialiser::Error> stash, and then follow the scalar reference to
  see if it's C<1> (true), C<0> (false) or C<undef> (error).
  
  While it is possible to use an isa test, directly comparing stash pointers
  is faster and guaranteed to work.
  
  For historical reasons, the C<Types::Serialiser::Boolean> stash is
  just an alias for C<JSON::PP::Boolean>. When printed, the classname
  with usually be C<JSON::PP::Boolean>, but isa tests and stash pointer
  comparison will normally work correctly (i.e. Types::Serialiser::true ISA
  JSON::PP::Boolean, but also ISA Types::Serialiser::Boolean).
  
  =head1 A GENERIC OBJECT SERIALIATION PROTOCOL
  
  This section explains the object serialisation protocol used by
  L<CBOR::XS>. It is meant to be generic enough to support any kind of
  generic object serialiser.
  
  This protocol is called "the Types::Serialiser object serialisation
  protocol".
  
  =head2 ENCODING
  
  When the encoder encounters an object that it cannot otherwise encode (for
  example, L<CBOR::XS> can encode a few special types itself, and will first
  attempt to use the special C<TO_CBOR> serialisation protocol), it will
  look up the C<FREEZE> method on the object.
  
  Note that the C<FREEZE> method will normally be called I<during> encoding,
  and I<MUST NOT> change the data structure that is being encoded in any
  way, or it might cause memory corruption or worse.
  
  If it exists, it will call it with two arguments: the object to serialise,
  and a constant string that indicates the name of the data model. For
  example L<CBOR::XS> uses C<CBOR>, and the L<JSON> and L<JSON::XS> modules
  (or any other JSON serialiser), would use C<JSON> as second argument.
  
  The C<FREEZE> method can then return zero or more values to identify the
  object instance. The serialiser is then supposed to encode the class name
  and all of these return values (which must be encodable in the format)
  using the relevant form for Perl objects. In CBOR for example, there is a
  registered tag number for encoded perl objects.
  
  The values that C<FREEZE> returns must be serialisable with the serialiser
  that calls it. Therefore, it is recommended to use simple types such as
  strings and numbers, and maybe array references and hashes (basically, the
  JSON data model). You can always use a more complex format for a specific
  data model by checking the second argument, the data model.
  
  The "data model" is not the same as the "data format" - the data model
  indicates what types and kinds of return values can be returned from
  C<FREEZE>. For example, in C<CBOR> it is permissible to return tagged CBOR
  values, while JSON does not support these at all, so C<JSON> would be a
  valid (but too limited) data model name for C<CBOR::XS>. similarly, a
  serialising format that supports more or less the same data model as JSON
  could use C<JSON> as data model without losing anything.
  
  =head2 DECODING
  
  When the decoder then encounters such an encoded perl object, it should
  look up the C<THAW> method on the stored classname, and invoke it with the
  classname, the constant string to identify the data model/data format, and
  all the return values returned by C<FREEZE>.
  
  =head2 EXAMPLES
  
  See the C<OBJECT SERIALISATION> section in the L<CBOR::XS> manpage for
  more details, an example implementation, and code examples.
  
  Here is an example C<FREEZE>/C<THAW> method pair:
  
     sub My::Object::FREEZE {
        my ($self, $model) = @_;
  
        ($self->{type}, $self->{id}, $self->{variant})
     }
  
     sub My::Object::THAW {
        my ($class, $model, $type, $id, $variant) = @_;
  
        $class->new (type => $type, id => $id, variant => $variant)
     }
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  The use of L<overload> makes this module much heavier than it should be
  (on my system, this module: 4kB RSS, overload: 260kB RSS).
  
  =head1 SEE ALSO
  
  Currently, L<JSON::XS> and L<CBOR::XS> use these types.

             (http://fleur.hio.jp/perldoc/mix/lib/JSON/XS.html)
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   use JSON::XS;
  
   # exported functions, they croak on error

   # and do the same things, except that you have a pure-perl fallback now.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa. Its
  primary goal is to be I<correct> and its secondary goal is to be
  I<fast>. To reach the latter goal it was written in C.
  
  Beginning with version 2.0 of the JSON module, when both JSON and
  JSON::XS are installed, then JSON will fall back on JSON::XS (this can be
  overridden) with no overhead due to emulation (by inheriting constructor
  and methods). If JSON::XS is not available, it will fall back to the
  compatible JSON::PP module as backend, so using JSON instead of JSON::XS
  gives you a portable JSON API that can be fast when you need and doesn't
  require a C compiler when that is a problem.
  
  As this is the n-th-something JSON module on CPAN, what was the reason
  to write yet another JSON module? While it seems there are many JSON
  modules, none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most cases
  their maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not listening to bug
  reports for other reasons.
  
  See MAPPING, below, on how JSON::XS maps perl values to JSON values and
  vice versa.
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * correct Unicode handling
  
  This module knows how to handle Unicode, documents how and when it does
  so, and even documents what "correct" means.
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
  by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
  level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
  it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
  MAPPING section below to learn about those.
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security
  feature).
  
  =item * fast
  
  Compared to other JSON modules and other serialisers such as Storable,
  this module usually compares favourably in terms of speed, too.
  
  =item * simple to use
  
  This module has both a simple functional interface as well as an object
  oriented interface.
  
  =item * reasonably versatile output formats
  
  You can choose between the most compact guaranteed-single-line format
  possible (nice for simple line-based protocols), a pure-ASCII format
  (for when your transport is not 8-bit clean, still supports the whole
  Unicode range), or a pretty-printed format (for when you want to read that
  stuff). Or you can combine those features in whatever way you like.

  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  The following convenience methods are provided by this module. They are
  exported by default:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string
  (that is, the string contains octets only). Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $json_text = JSON::XS->new->utf8->encode ($perl_scalar)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =item $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference. Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $perl_scalar = JSON::XS->new->utf8->decode ($json_text)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head1 A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL
  
  Since this often leads to confusion, here are a few very clear words on
  how Unicode works in Perl, modulo bugs.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1. Perl strings can store characters with ordinal values > 255.
  
  This enables you to store Unicode characters as single characters in a
  Perl string - very natural.
  
  =item 2. Perl does I<not> associate an encoding with your strings.
  
  ... until you force it to, e.g. when matching it against a regex, or
  printing the scalar to a file, in which case Perl either interprets your
  string as locale-encoded text, octets/binary, or as Unicode, depending
  on various settings. In no case is an encoding stored together with your
  data, it is I<use> that decides encoding, not any magical meta data.
  
  =item 3. The internal utf-8 flag has no meaning with regards to the
  encoding of your string.
  
  Just ignore that flag unless you debug a Perl bug, a module written in
  XS or want to dive into the internals of perl. Otherwise it will only
  confuse you, as, despite the name, it says nothing about how your string
  is encoded. You can have Unicode strings with that flag set, with that
  flag clear, and you can have binary data with that flag set and that flag
  clear. Other possibilities exist, too.
  
  If you didn't know about that flag, just the better, pretend it doesn't
  exist.
  
  =item 4. A "Unicode String" is simply a string where each character can be
  validly interpreted as a Unicode code point.
  
  If you have UTF-8 encoded data, it is no longer a Unicode string, but a
  Unicode string encoded in UTF-8, giving you a binary string.
  
  =item 5. A string containing "high" (> 255) character values is I<not> a UTF-8 string.
  
  It's a fact. Learn to live with it.
  
  =back
  
  I hope this helps :)
  
  
  =head1 OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  The object oriented interface lets you configure your own encoding or
  decoding style, within the limits of supported formats.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $json = new JSON::XS
  
  Creates a new JSON::XS object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings. All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->utf8->space_after->encode ({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =item $json = $json->ascii ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  generate characters outside the code range C<0..127> (which is ASCII). Any
  Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either a
  single \uXXXX (BMP characters) or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence,
  as per RFC4627. The resulting encoded JSON text can be treated as a native
  Unicode string, an ascii-encoded, latin1-encoded or UTF-8 encoded string,
  or any other superset of ASCII.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results
  in a faster and more compact format.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  The main use for this flag is to produce JSON texts that can be
  transmitted over a 7-bit channel, as the encoded JSON texts will not
  contain any 8 bit characters.
  
    JSON::XS->new->ascii (1)->encode ([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =item $json = $json->latin1 ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the resulting JSON text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters
  outside the code range C<0..255>. The resulting string can be treated as a
  latin1-encoded JSON text or a native Unicode string. The C<decode> method
  will not be affected in any way by this flag, as C<decode> by default
  expects Unicode, which is a strict superset of latin1.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  The main use for this flag is efficiently encoding binary data as JSON
  text, as most octets will not be escaped, resulting in a smaller encoded
  size. The disadvantage is that the resulting JSON text is encoded
  in latin1 (and must correctly be treated as such when storing and
  transferring), a rare encoding for JSON. It is therefore most useful when
  you want to store data structures known to contain binary data efficiently
  in files or databases, not when talking to other JSON encoders/decoders.
  
    JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  =item $json = $json->utf8 ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the JSON result into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the
  C<decode> method expects to be handled an UTF-8-encoded string.  Please
  note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any characters outside the
  range C<0..255>, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O. In future
  versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16
  and UTF-32 encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will return the JSON
  string as a (non-encoded) Unicode string, while C<decode> expects thus a
  Unicode string.  Any decoding or encoding (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs
  to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::XS->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::XS->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  =item $json = $json->pretty ([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> (and in the future possibly more) flags in one call to
  generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Example, pretty-print some simple structure:
  
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->pretty(1)->encode ({a => [1,2]})
     =>
     {
        "a" : [
           1,
           2
        ]
     }
  
  =item $json = $json->indent ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will use a multiline
  format as output, putting every array member or object/hash key-value pair
  into its own line, indenting them properly.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the
  resulting JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any C<newlines>.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  =item $json = $json->space_before ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts. You will also
  most likely combine this setting with C<space_after>.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =item $json = $json->space_after ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =item $json = $json->relaxed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...

  =item * literal ASCII TAB characters in strings
  
  Literal ASCII TAB characters are now allowed in strings (and treated as
  C<\t>).

  =item $json = $json->canonical ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script, and can change even within the same run from 5.18
  onwards).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  This setting has currently no effect on tied hashes.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_nonref ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
  Example, encode a Perl scalar as JSON value with enabled C<allow_nonref>,
  resulting in an invalid JSON text:
  
     JSON::XS->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will I<not> throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON C<null> value. Note
  that blessed objects are not included here and are handled separately by
  c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect C<decode> in any way, and it is recommended to
  leave it off unless you know your communications partner.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_blessed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference that it cannot convert
  otherwise. Instead, a JSON C<null> value is encoded instead of the object.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object that it cannot convert
  otherwise.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =item $json = $json->convert_blessed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context and
  the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with any C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will not consider
  this type of conversion.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_tags ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->allow_tags
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<FREEZE> method on
  the object's class. If found, it will be used to serialise the object into
  a nonstandard tagged JSON value (that JSON decoders cannot decode).
  
  It also causes C<decode> to parse such tagged JSON values and deserialise
  them via a call to the C<THAW> method.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will not consider
  this type of conversion, and tagged JSON values will cause a parse error
  in C<decode>, as if tags were not part of the grammar.
  
  =item $json = $json->filter_json_object ([$coderef->($hashref)])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument is a reference to the
  newly-created hash. If the code references returns a single scalar (which
  need not be a reference), this value (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid
  aliasing) is inserted into the deserialised data structure. If it returns
  an empty list (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the
  original deserialised hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down
  decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::XS->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]')
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =item $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object ($key [=> $coderef->($value)])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::XS
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =item $json = $json->shrink ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  Perl usually over-allocates memory a bit when allocating space for
  strings. This flag optionally resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible. This can save
  memory when your JSON texts are either very very long or you have many
  short strings. It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form
  if possible: perl stores strings internally either in an encoding called
  UTF-X or in octet-form. The latter cannot store everything but uses less
  space in general (and some buggy Perl or C code might even rely on that
  internal representation being used).
  
  The actual definition of what shrink does might change in future versions,
  but it will always try to save space at the expense of time.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), the string returned by C<encode> will
  be shrunk-to-fit, while all strings generated by C<decode> will also be
  shrunk-to-fit.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the normal perl allocation algorithms are used.
  If you work with your data, then this is likely to be faster.
  
  In the future, this setting might control other things, such as converting
  strings that look like integers or floats into integers or floats
  internally (there is no difference on the Perl level), saving space.
  
  =item $json = $json->max_depth ([$maximum_nesting_depth])
  
  =item $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  Setting the maximum depth to one disallows any nesting, so that ensures
  that the object is only a single hash/object or array.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  Note that nesting is implemented by recursion in C. The default value has
  been chosen to be as large as typical operating systems allow without
  crashing.
  
  See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =item $json = $json->max_size ([$maximum_string_size])
  
  =item $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =item $json_text = $json->encode ($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl value or data structure to its JSON
  representation. Croaks on error.
  
  =item $perl_scalar = $json->decode ($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  =item ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix ($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
  This is useful if your JSON texts are not delimited by an outer protocol
  and you need to know where the JSON text ends.

  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON
  texts. While this module always has to keep both JSON text and resulting
  Perl data structure in memory at one time, it does allow you to parse a
  JSON stream incrementally. It does so by accumulating text until it has
  a full JSON object, which it then can decode. This process is similar to
  using C<decode_prefix> to see if a full JSON object is available, but
  is much more efficient (and can be implemented with a minimum of method
  calls).
  
  JSON::XS will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect mismatched
  parentheses. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item [void, scalar or list context] = $json->incr_parse ([$string])
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return
  them.
  
     my @objs = JSON::XS->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =item $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
  =item $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove
  the parsed text from the input buffer so far. This is useful after
  C<incr_parse> died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser
  state is left unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the
  parse state.
  
  The difference to C<incr_reset> is that only text until the parse error
  occurred is removed.
  
  =item $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 LIMITATIONS
  
  All options that affect decoding are supported, except
  C<allow_nonref>. The reason for this is that it cannot be made to work
  sensibly: JSON objects and arrays are self-delimited, i.e. you can
  concatenate them back to back and still decode them perfectly. This does
  not hold true for JSON numbers, however.
  
  For example, is the string C<1> a single JSON number, or is it simply the
  start of C<12>? Or is C<12> a single JSON number, or the concatenation
  of C<1> and C<2>? In neither case you can tell, and this is why JSON::XS
  takes the conservative route and disallows this case.
  
  =head2 EXAMPLES
  
  Some examples will make all this clearer. First, a simple example that
  works similarly to C<decode_prefix>: We want to decode the JSON object at
  the start of a string and identify the portion after the JSON object:
  
     my $text = "[1,2,3] hello";
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     my $obj = $json->incr_parse ($text)
        or die "expected JSON object or array at beginning of string";
  
     my $tail = $json->incr_text;
     # $tail now contains " hello"
  
  Easy, isn't it?
  
  Now for a more complicated example: Imagine a hypothetical protocol where
  you read some requests from a TCP stream, and each request is a JSON
  array, without any separation between them (in fact, it is often useful to
  use newlines as "separators", as these get interpreted as whitespace at
  the start of the JSON text, which makes it possible to test said protocol
  with C<telnet>...).
  
  Here is how you'd do it (it is trivial to write this in an event-based
  manner):
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # read some data from the socket
     while (sysread $socket, my $buf, 4096) {
  
        # split and decode as many requests as possible
        for my $request ($json->incr_parse ($buf)) {
           # act on the $request
        }
     }
  
  Another complicated example: Assume you have a string with JSON objects
  or arrays, all separated by (optional) comma characters (e.g. C<[1],[2],
  [3]>). To parse them, we have to skip the commas between the JSON texts,
  and here is where the lvalue-ness of C<incr_text> comes in useful:
  
     my $text = "[1],[2], [3]";
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # void context, so no parsing done
     $json->incr_parse ($text);
  
     # now extract as many objects as possible. note the
     # use of scalar context so incr_text can be called.
     while (my $obj = $json->incr_parse) {
        # do something with $obj
  
        # now skip the optional comma
        $json->incr_text =~ s/^ \s* , //x;
     }
  
  Now lets go for a very complex example: Assume that you have a gigantic
  JSON array-of-objects, many gigabytes in size, and you want to parse it,
  but you cannot load it into memory fully (this has actually happened in
  the real world :).
  
  Well, you lost, you have to implement your own JSON parser. But JSON::XS
  can still help you: You implement a (very simple) array parser and let
  JSON decode the array elements, which are all full JSON objects on their
  own (this wouldn't work if the array elements could be JSON numbers, for
  example):
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # open the monster
     open my $fh, "<bigfile.json"
        or die "bigfile: $!";
  
     # first parse the initial "["
     for (;;) {
        sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
           or die "read error: $!";
        $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
  
        # Exit the loop once we found and removed(!) the initial "[".
        # In essence, we are (ab-)using the $json object as a simple scalar
        # we append data to.
        last if $json->incr_text =~ s/^ \s* \[ //x;
     }
  
     # now we have the skipped the initial "[", so continue
     # parsing all the elements.
     for (;;) {
        # in this loop we read data until we got a single JSON object
        for (;;) {
           if (my $obj = $json->incr_parse) {
              # do something with $obj
              last;
           }
  
           # add more data
           sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
              or die "read error: $!";
           $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
        }
  
        # in this loop we read data until we either found and parsed the
        # separating "," between elements, or the final "]"
        for (;;) {
           # first skip whitespace
           $json->incr_text =~ s/^\s*//;
  
           # if we find "]", we are done
           if ($json->incr_text =~ s/^\]//) {
              print "finished.\n";
              exit;
           }
  
           # if we find ",", we can continue with the next element
           if ($json->incr_text =~ s/^,//) {
              last;
           }
  
           # if we find anything else, we have a parse error!
           if (length $json->incr_text) {
              die "parse error near ", $json->incr_text;
           }
  
           # else add more data
           sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
              or die "read error: $!";
           $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
        }
  
  This is a complex example, but most of the complexity comes from the fact
  that we are trying to be correct (bear with me if I am wrong, I never ran
  the above example :).
  
  
  
  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section describes how JSON::XS maps Perl values to JSON values and
  vice versa. These mappings are designed to "do the right thing" in most
  circumstances automatically, preserving round-tripping characteristics
  (what you put in comes out as something equivalent).
  
  For the more enlightened: note that in the following descriptions,
  lowercase I<perl> refers to the Perl interpreter, while uppercase I<Perl>
  refers to the abstract Perl language itself.
  
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserve object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, JSON::XS will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, JSON::XS only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<Types::Serialiser::true> and
  C<Types::Serialiser::false>, respectively. They are overloaded to act
  almost exactly like the numbers C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether
  a scalar is a JSON boolean by using the C<Types::Serialiser::is_bool>
  function (after C<use Types::Serialier>, of course).
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  =item shell-style comments (C<< # I<text> >>)
  
  As a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax that is enabled by the
  C<relaxed> setting, shell-style comments are allowed. They can start
  anywhere outside strings and go till the end of the line.
  
  =item tagged values (C<< (I<tag>)I<value> >>).
  
  Another nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax, enabled with the
  C<allow_tags> setting, are tagged values. In this implementation, the
  I<tag> must be a perl package/class name encoded as a JSON string, and the
  I<value> must be a JSON array encoding optional constructor arguments.
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION>, below, for details.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent
  ordering in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded
  in a pseudo-random order. JSON::XS can optionally sort the hash keys
  (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so the same datastructure will
  serialise to the same JSON text (given same settings and version of
  JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead and is only rarely useful,
  e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text against another for equality.
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON.
  
  Since C<JSON::XS> uses the boolean model from L<Types::Serialiser>, you
  can also C<use Types::Serialiser> and then use C<Types::Serialiser::false>
  and C<Types::Serialiser::true> to improve readability.
  
     use Types::Serialiser;
     encode_json [\0, Types::Serialiser::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item Types::Serialiser::true, Types::Serialiser::false
  
  These special values from the L<Types::Serialiser> module become JSON true
  and JSON false values, respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0>
  directly if you want.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON, but C<JSON::XS>
  allows various ways of handling objects. See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION>,
  below, for details.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a JSON string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a JSON number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways. Tell me
  if you need this capability (but don't forget to explain why it's needed
  :).
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 OBJECT SERIALISATION
  
  As JSON cannot directly represent Perl objects, you have to choose between
  a pure JSON representation (without the ability to deserialise the object
  automatically again), and a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax,
  tagged values.
  
  =head3 SERIALISATION
  
  What happens when C<JSON::XS> encounters a Perl object depends on the
  C<allow_blessed>, C<convert_blessed> and C<allow_tags> settings, which are
  used in this order:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1. C<allow_tags> is enabled and the object has a C<FREEZE> method.
  
  In this case, C<JSON::XS> uses the L<Types::Serialiser> object
  serialisation protocol to create a tagged JSON value, using a nonstandard
  extension to the JSON syntax.
  
  This works by invoking the C<FREEZE> method on the object, with the first
  argument being the object to serialise, and the second argument being the
  constant string C<JSON> to distinguish it from other serialisers.
  
  The C<FREEZE> method can return any number of values (i.e. zero or
  more). These values and the paclkage/classname of the object will then be
  encoded as a tagged JSON value in the following format:
  
     ("classname")[FREEZE return values...]
  
  e.g.:
  
     ("URI")["http://www.google.com/"]
     ("MyDate")[2013,10,29]
     ("ImageData::JPEG")["Z3...VlCg=="]
  
  For example, the hypothetical C<My::Object> C<FREEZE> method might use the
  objects C<type> and C<id> members to encode the object:
  
     sub My::Object::FREEZE {
        my ($self, $serialiser) = @_;
  
        ($self->{type}, $self->{id})
     }
  
  =item 2. C<convert_blessed> is enabled and the object has a C<TO_JSON> method.
  
  In this case, the C<TO_JSON> method of the object is invoked in scalar
  context. It must return a single scalar that can be directly encoded into
  JSON. This scalar replaces the object in the JSON text.
  
  For example, the following C<TO_JSON> method will convert all L<URI>
  objects to JSON strings when serialised. The fatc that these values
  originally were L<URI> objects is lost.
  
     sub URI::TO_JSON {
        my ($uri) = @_;
        $uri->as_string
     }
  
  =item 3. C<allow_blessed> is enabled.
  
  The object will be serialised as a JSON null value.
  
  =item 4. none of the above
  
  If none of the settings are enabled or the respective methods are missing,
  C<JSON::XS> throws an exception.
  
  =back
  
  =head3 DESERIALISATION
  
  For deserialisation there are only two cases to consider: either
  nonstandard tagging was used, in which case C<allow_tags> decides,
  or objects cannot be automatically be deserialised, in which
  case you can use postprocessing or the C<filter_json_object> or
  C<filter_json_single_key_object> callbacks to get some real objects our of
  your JSON.
  
  This section only considers the tagged value case: I a tagged JSON object
  is encountered during decoding and C<allow_tags> is disabled, a parse
  error will result (as if tagged values were not part of the grammar).
  
  If C<allow_tags> is enabled, C<JSON::XS> will look up the C<THAW> method
  of the package/classname used during serialisation (it will not attempt
  to load the package as a Perl module). If there is no such method, the
  decoding will fail with an error.
  
  Otherwise, the C<THAW> method is invoked with the classname as first
  argument, the constant string C<JSON> as second argument, and all the
  values from the JSON array (the values originally returned by the
  C<FREEZE> method) as remaining arguments.
  
  The method must then return the object. While technically you can return
  any Perl scalar, you might have to enable the C<enable_nonref> setting to
  make that work in all cases, so better return an actual blessed reference.
  
  As an example, let's implement a C<THAW> function that regenerates the
  C<My::Object> from the C<FREEZE> example earlier:
  
     sub My::Object::THAW {
        my ($class, $serialiser, $type, $id) = @_;
  
        $class->new (type => $type, id => $id)
     }
  
  
  =head1 ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES
  
  The interested reader might have seen a number of flags that signify
  encodings or codesets - C<utf8>, C<latin1> and C<ascii>. There seems to be
  some confusion on what these do, so here is a short comparison:
  
  C<utf8> controls whether the JSON text created by C<encode> (and expected
  by C<decode>) is UTF-8 encoded or not, while C<latin1> and C<ascii> only
  control whether C<encode> escapes character values outside their respective
  codeset range. Neither of these flags conflict with each other, although
  some combinations make less sense than others.
  
  Care has been taken to make all flags symmetrical with respect to
  C<encode> and C<decode>, that is, texts encoded with any combination of
  these flag values will be correctly decoded when the same flags are used
  - in general, if you use different flag settings while encoding vs. when
  decoding you likely have a bug somewhere.
  
  Below comes a verbose discussion of these flags. Note that a "codeset" is
  simply an abstract set of character-codepoint pairs, while an encoding
  takes those codepoint numbers and I<encodes> them, in our case into
  octets. Unicode is (among other things) a codeset, UTF-8 is an encoding,
  and ISO-8859-1 (= latin 1) and ASCII are both codesets I<and> encodings at
  the same time, which can be confusing.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item C<utf8> flag disabled
  
  When C<utf8> is disabled (the default), then C<encode>/C<decode> generate
  and expect Unicode strings, that is, characters with high ordinal Unicode
  values (> 255) will be encoded as such characters, and likewise such
  characters are decoded as-is, no changes to them will be done, except
  "(re-)interpreting" them as Unicode codepoints or Unicode characters,
  respectively (to Perl, these are the same thing in strings unless you do
  funny/weird/dumb stuff).
  
  This is useful when you want to do the encoding yourself (e.g. when you
  want to have UTF-16 encoded JSON texts) or when some other layer does
  the encoding for you (for example, when printing to a terminal using a
  filehandle that transparently encodes to UTF-8 you certainly do NOT want
  to UTF-8 encode your data first and have Perl encode it another time).
  
  =item C<utf8> flag enabled
  
  If the C<utf8>-flag is enabled, C<encode>/C<decode> will encode all
  characters using the corresponding UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, and will
  expect your input strings to be encoded as UTF-8, that is, no "character"
  of the input string must have any value > 255, as UTF-8 does not allow
  that.
  
  The C<utf8> flag therefore switches between two modes: disabled means you
  will get a Unicode string in Perl, enabled means you get an UTF-8 encoded
  octet/binary string in Perl.
  
  =item C<latin1> or C<ascii> flags enabled
  
  With C<latin1> (or C<ascii>) enabled, C<encode> will escape characters
  with ordinal values > 255 (> 127 with C<ascii>) and encode the remaining
  characters as specified by the C<utf8> flag.
  
  If C<utf8> is disabled, then the result is also correctly encoded in those
  character sets (as both are proper subsets of Unicode, meaning that a
  Unicode string with all character values < 256 is the same thing as a
  ISO-8859-1 string, and a Unicode string with all character values < 128 is
  the same thing as an ASCII string in Perl).
  
  If C<utf8> is enabled, you still get a correct UTF-8-encoded string,
  regardless of these flags, just some more characters will be escaped using
  C<\uXXXX> then before.
  
  Note that ISO-8859-1-I<encoded> strings are not compatible with UTF-8
  encoding, while ASCII-encoded strings are. That is because the ISO-8859-1
  encoding is NOT a subset of UTF-8 (despite the ISO-8859-1 I<codeset> being
  a subset of Unicode), while ASCII is.
  
  Surprisingly, C<decode> will ignore these flags and so treat all input
  values as governed by the C<utf8> flag. If it is disabled, this allows you
  to decode ISO-8859-1- and ASCII-encoded strings, as both strict subsets of
  Unicode. If it is enabled, you can correctly decode UTF-8 encoded strings.
  
  So neither C<latin1> nor C<ascii> are incompatible with the C<utf8> flag -
  they only govern when the JSON output engine escapes a character or not.
  
  The main use for C<latin1> is to relatively efficiently store binary data
  as JSON, at the expense of breaking compatibility with most JSON decoders.
  
  The main use for C<ascii> is to force the output to not contain characters
  with values > 127, which means you can interpret the resulting string
  as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ASCII, KOI8-R or most about any character set and
  8-bit-encoding, and still get the same data structure back. This is useful
  when your channel for JSON transfer is not 8-bit clean or the encoding
  might be mangled in between (e.g. in mail), and works because ASCII is a
  proper subset of most 8-bit and multibyte encodings in use in the world.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 JSON and ECMAscript
  
  JSON syntax is based on how literals are represented in javascript (the
  not-standardised predecessor of ECMAscript) which is presumably why it is
  called "JavaScript Object Notation".
  
  However, JSON is not a subset (and also not a superset of course) of
  ECMAscript (the standard) or javascript (whatever browsers actually
  implement).
  
  If you want to use javascript's C<eval> function to "parse" JSON, you
  might run into parse errors for valid JSON texts, or the resulting data
  structure might not be queryable:
  
  One of the problems is that U+2028 and U+2029 are valid characters inside
  JSON strings, but are not allowed in ECMAscript string literals, so the
  following Perl fragment will not output something that can be guaranteed
  to be parsable by javascript's C<eval>:
  
     use JSON::XS;
  
     print encode_json [chr 0x2028];
  
  The right fix for this is to use a proper JSON parser in your javascript
  programs, and not rely on C<eval> (see for example Douglas Crockford's
  F<json2.js> parser).
  
  If this is not an option, you can, as a stop-gap measure, simply encode to
  ASCII-only JSON:
  
     use JSON::XS;
  
     print JSON::XS->new->ascii->encode ([chr 0x2028]);
  
  Note that this will enlarge the resulting JSON text quite a bit if you
  have many non-ASCII characters. You might be tempted to run some regexes
  to only escape U+2028 and U+2029, e.g.:
  
     # DO NOT USE THIS!
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->utf8->encode ([chr 0x2028]);
     $json =~ s/\xe2\x80\xa8/\\u2028/g; # escape U+2028
     $json =~ s/\xe2\x80\xa9/\\u2029/g; # escape U+2029
     print $json;
  
  Note that I<this is a bad idea>: the above only works for U+2028 and
  U+2029 and thus only for fully ECMAscript-compliant parsers. Many existing
  javascript implementations, however, have issues with other characters as
  well - using C<eval> naively simply I<will> cause problems.
  
  Another problem is that some javascript implementations reserve
  some property names for their own purposes (which probably makes
  them non-ECMAscript-compliant). For example, Iceweasel reserves the
  C<__proto__> property name for its own purposes.
  
  If that is a problem, you could parse try to filter the resulting JSON
  output for these property strings, e.g.:
  
     $json =~ s/"__proto__"\s*:/"__proto__renamed":/g;
  
  This works because C<__proto__> is not valid outside of strings, so every
  occurrence of C<"__proto__"\s*:> must be a string used as property name.
  
  If you know of other incompatibilities, please let me know.
  
  
  =head2 JSON and YAML
  
  You often hear that JSON is a subset of YAML. This is, however, a mass
  hysteria(*) and very far from the truth (as of the time of this writing),
  so let me state it clearly: I<in general, there is no way to configure
  JSON::XS to output a data structure as valid YAML> that works in all
  cases.
  
  If you really must use JSON::XS to generate YAML, you should use this
  algorithm (subject to change in future versions):
  
     my $to_yaml = JSON::XS->new->utf8->space_after (1);
     my $yaml = $to_yaml->encode ($ref) . "\n";
  
  This will I<usually> generate JSON texts that also parse as valid
  YAML. Please note that YAML has hardcoded limits on (simple) object key
  lengths that JSON doesn't have and also has different and incompatible
  unicode character escape syntax, so you should make sure that your hash
  keys are noticeably shorter than the 1024 "stream characters" YAML allows
  and that you do not have characters with codepoint values outside the
  Unicode BMP (basic multilingual page). YAML also does not allow C<\/>
  sequences in strings (which JSON::XS does not I<currently> generate, but
  other JSON generators might).
  
  There might be other incompatibilities that I am not aware of (or the YAML
  specification has been changed yet again - it does so quite often). In
  general you should not try to generate YAML with a JSON generator or vice
  versa, or try to parse JSON with a YAML parser or vice versa: chances are
  high that you will run into severe interoperability problems when you
  least expect it.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item (*)
  
  I have been pressured multiple times by Brian Ingerson (one of the
  authors of the YAML specification) to remove this paragraph, despite him
  acknowledging that the actual incompatibilities exist. As I was personally
  bitten by this "JSON is YAML" lie, I refused and said I will continue to
  educate people about these issues, so others do not run into the same
  problem again and again. After this, Brian called me a (quote)I<complete
  and worthless idiot>(unquote).
  
  In my opinion, instead of pressuring and insulting people who actually
  clarify issues with YAML and the wrong statements of some of its
  proponents, I would kindly suggest reading the JSON spec (which is not
  that difficult or long) and finally make YAML compatible to it, and
  educating users about the changes, instead of spreading lies about the
  real compatibility for many I<years> and trying to silence people who
  point out that it isn't true.
  
  Addendum/2009: the YAML 1.2 spec is still incompatible with JSON, even
  though the incompatibilities have been documented (and are known to Brian)
  for many years and the spec makes explicit claims that YAML is a superset
  of JSON. It would be so easy to fix, but apparently, bullying people and
  corrupting userdata is so much easier.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 SPEED
  
  It seems that JSON::XS is surprisingly fast, as shown in the following
  tables. They have been generated with the help of the C<eg/bench> program
  in the JSON::XS distribution, to make it easy to compare on your own
  system.
  
  First comes a comparison between various modules using
  a very short single-line JSON string (also available at
  L<http://dist.schmorp.de/misc/json/short.json>).
  
     {"method": "handleMessage", "params": ["user1",
     "we were just talking"], "id": null, "array":[1,11,234,-5,1e5,1e7,
     1,  0]}
  
  It shows the number of encodes/decodes per second (JSON::XS uses
  the functional interface, while JSON::XS/2 uses the OO interface
  with pretty-printing and hashkey sorting enabled, JSON::XS/3 enables
  shrink. JSON::DWIW/DS uses the deserialise function, while JSON::DWIW::FJ
  uses the from_json method). Higher is better:
  
     module        |     encode |     decode |
     --------------|------------|------------|
     JSON::DWIW/DS |  86302.551 | 102300.098 |
     JSON::DWIW/FJ |  86302.551 |  75983.768 |
     JSON::PP      |  15827.562 |   6638.658 |
     JSON::Syck    |  63358.066 |  47662.545 |
     JSON::XS      | 511500.488 | 511500.488 |
     JSON::XS/2    | 291271.111 | 388361.481 |
     JSON::XS/3    | 361577.931 | 361577.931 |
     Storable      |  66788.280 | 265462.278 |
     --------------+------------+------------+
  
  That is, JSON::XS is almost six times faster than JSON::DWIW on encoding,
  about five times faster on decoding, and over thirty to seventy times
  faster than JSON's pure perl implementation. It also compares favourably
  to Storable for small amounts of data.
  
  Using a longer test string (roughly 18KB, generated from Yahoo! Locals
  search API (L<http://dist.schmorp.de/misc/json/long.json>).
  
     module        |     encode |     decode |
     --------------|------------|------------|
     JSON::DWIW/DS |   1647.927 |   2673.916 |
     JSON::DWIW/FJ |   1630.249 |   2596.128 |
     JSON::PP      |    400.640 |     62.311 |
     JSON::Syck    |   1481.040 |   1524.869 |
     JSON::XS      |  20661.596 |   9541.183 |
     JSON::XS/2    |  10683.403 |   9416.938 |
     JSON::XS/3    |  20661.596 |   9400.054 |
     Storable      |  19765.806 |  10000.725 |
     --------------+------------+------------+
  
  Again, JSON::XS leads by far (except for Storable which non-surprisingly
  decodes a bit faster).
  
  On large strings containing lots of high Unicode characters, some modules
  (such as JSON::PC) seem to decode faster than JSON::XS, but the result
  will be broken due to missing (or wrong) Unicode handling. Others refuse
  to decode or encode properly, so it was impossible to prepare a fair
  comparison table for that case.
  
  
  =head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  
  When you are using JSON in a protocol, talking to untrusted potentially
  hostile creatures requires relatively few measures.
  
  First of all, your JSON decoder should be secure, that is, should not have
  any buffer overflows. Obviously, this module should ensure that and I am
  trying hard on making that true, but you never know.
  
  Second, you need to avoid resource-starving attacks. That means you should
  limit the size of JSON texts you accept, or make sure then when your
  resources run out, that's just fine (e.g. by using a separate process that
  can crash safely). The size of a JSON text in octets or characters is
  usually a good indication of the size of the resources required to decode
  it into a Perl structure. While JSON::XS can check the size of the JSON
  text, it might be too late when you already have it in memory, so you
  might want to check the size before you accept the string.
  
  Third, JSON::XS recurses using the C stack when decoding objects and
  arrays. The C stack is a limited resource: for instance, on my amd64
  machine with 8MB of stack size I can decode around 180k nested arrays but
  only 14k nested JSON objects (due to perl itself recursing deeply on croak
  to free the temporary). If that is exceeded, the program crashes. To be
  conservative, the default nesting limit is set to 512. If your process
  has a smaller stack, you should adjust this setting accordingly with the
  C<max_depth> method.
  
  Something else could bomb you, too, that I forgot to think of. In that
  case, you get to keep the pieces. I am always open for hints, though...
  
  Also keep in mind that JSON::XS might leak contents of your Perl data
  structures in its error messages, so when you serialise sensitive
  information you might want to make sure that exceptions thrown by JSON::XS
  will not end up in front of untrusted eyes.
  
  If you are using JSON::XS to return packets to consumption
  by JavaScript scripts in a browser you should have a look at
  L<http://blog.archive.jpsykes.com/47/practical-csrf-and-json-security/> to
  see whether you are vulnerable to some common attack vectors (which really
  are browser design bugs, but it is still you who will have to deal with
  it, as major browser developers care only for features, not about getting
  security right).
  
  
  =head1 "OLD" VS. "NEW" JSON (RFC 4627 VS. RFC 7159)
  
  TL;DR: Due to security concerns, JSON::XS will not allow scalar data in
  JSON texts by default - you need to create your own JSON::XS object and
  enable C<allow_nonref>:
  
  
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->allow_nonref;
  
     $text = $json->encode ($data);
     $data = $json->decode ($text);
  
  The long version: JSON being an important and supposedly stable format,
  the IETF standardised it as RFC 4627 in 2006. Unfortunately, the inventor
  of JSON, Dougles Crockford, unilaterally changed the definition of JSON in
  javascript. Rather than create a fork, the IETF decided to standardise the
  new syntax (apparently, so Iw as told, without finding it very amusing).
  
  The biggest difference between thed original JSON and the new JSON is that
  the new JSON supports scalars (anything other than arrays and objects) at
  the toplevel of a JSON text. While this is strictly backwards compatible
  to older versions, it breaks a number of protocols that relied on sending
  JSON back-to-back, and is a minor security concern.
  
  For example, imagine you have two banks communicating, and on one side,
  trhe JSON coder gets upgraded. Two messages, such as C<10> and C<1000>
  might then be confused to mean C<101000>, something that couldn't happen
  in the original JSON, because niether of these messages would be valid
  JSON.
  
  If one side accepts these messages, then an upgrade in the coder on either
  side could result in this becoming exploitable.
  
  This module has always allowed these messages as an optional extension, by
  default disabled. The security concerns are the reason why the default is
  still disabled, but future versions might/will likely upgrade to the newer
  RFC as default format, so you are advised to check your implementation
  and/or override the default with C<< ->allow_nonref (0) >> to ensure that
  future versions are safe.
  
  
  =head1 INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER MODULES
  
  C<JSON::XS> uses the L<Types::Serialiser> module to provide boolean
  constants. That means that the JSON true and false values will be
  comaptible to true and false values of iother modules that do the same,
  such as L<JSON::PP> and L<CBOR::XS>.
  
  
  =head1 INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER JSON DECODERS
  
  As long as you only serialise data that can be directly expressed in JSON,
  C<JSON::XS> is incapable of generating invalid JSON output (modulo bugs,
  but C<JSON::XS> has found more bugs in the official JSON testsuite (1)
  than the official JSON testsuite has found in C<JSON::XS> (0)).
  
  When you have trouble decoding JSON generated by this module using other
  decoders, then it is very likely that you have an encoding mismatch or the
  other decoder is broken.
  
  When decoding, C<JSON::XS> is strict by default and will likely catch all
  errors. There are currently two settings that change this: C<relaxed>
  makes C<JSON::XS> accept (but not generate) some non-standard extensions,
  and C<allow_tags> will allow you to encode and decode Perl objects, at the
  cost of not outputting valid JSON anymore.
  
  =head2 TAGGED VALUE SYNTAX AND STANDARD JSON EN/DECODERS
  
  When you use C<allow_tags> to use the extended (and also nonstandard and
  invalid) JSON syntax for serialised objects, and you still want to decode
  the generated When you want to serialise objects, you can run a regex
  to replace the tagged syntax by standard JSON arrays (it only works for
  "normal" packagesnames without comma, newlines or single colons). First,
  the readable Perl version:
  
     # if your FREEZE methods return no values, you need this replace first:
     $json =~ s/\( \s* (" (?: [^\\":,]+|\\.|::)* ") \s* \) \s* \[\s*\]/[$1]/gx;
  
     # this works for non-empty constructor arg lists:
     $json =~ s/\( \s* (" (?: [^\\":,]+|\\.|::)* ") \s* \) \s* \[/[$1,/gx;
  
  And here is a less readable version that is easy to adapt to other
  languages:
  
     $json =~ s/\(\s*("([^\\":,]+|\\.|::)*")\s*\)\s*\[/[$1,/g;
  
  Here is an ECMAScript version (same regex):
  
     json = json.replace (/\(\s*("([^\\":,]+|\\.|::)*")\s*\)\s*\[/g, "[$1,");
  
  Since this syntax converts to standard JSON arrays, it might be hard to
  distinguish serialised objects from normal arrays. You can prepend a
  "magic number" as first array element to reduce chances of a collision:
  
     $json =~ s/\(\s*("([^\\":,]+|\\.|::)*")\s*\)\s*\[/["XU1peReLzT4ggEllLanBYq4G9VzliwKF",$1,/g;
  
  And after decoding the JSON text, you could walk the data
  structure looking for arrays with a first element of
  C<XU1peReLzT4ggEllLanBYq4G9VzliwKF>.
  
  The same approach can be used to create the tagged format with another
  encoder. First, you create an array with the magic string as first member,
  the classname as second, and constructor arguments last, encode it as part
  of your JSON structure, and then:
  
     $json =~ s/\[\s*"XU1peReLzT4ggEllLanBYq4G9VzliwKF"\s*,\s*("([^\\":,]+|\\.|::)*")\s*,/($1)[/g;
  
  Again, this has some limitations - the magic string must not be encoded
  with character escapes, and the constructor arguments must be non-empty.
  
  
  =head1 RFC7159
  
  Since this module was written, Google has written a new JSON RFC, RFC 7159
  (and RFC7158). Unfortunately, this RFC breaks compatibility with both the
  original JSON specification on www.json.org and RFC4627.
  
  As far as I can see, you can get partial compatibility when parsing by
  using C<< ->allow_nonref >>. However, consider thew security implications
  of doing so.
  
  I haven't decided yet when to break compatibility with RFC4627 by default
  (and potentially leave applications insecure) and change the default to
  follow RFC7159, but application authors are well advised to call C<<
  ->allow_nonref(0) >> even if this is the current default, if they cannot
  handle non-reference values, in preparation for the day when the4 default
  will change.
  
  
  =head1 THREADS
  
  This module is I<not> guaranteed to be thread safe and there are no
  plans to change this until Perl gets thread support (as opposed to the
  horribly slow so-called "threads" which are simply slow and bloated
  process simulations - use fork, it's I<much> faster, cheaper, better).
  
  (It might actually work, but you have been warned).
  
  
  =head1 THE PERILS OF SETLOCALE
  
  Sometimes people avoid the Perl locale support and directly call the
  system's setlocale function with C<LC_ALL>.
  
  This breaks both perl and modules such as JSON::XS, as stringification of
  numbers no longer works correctly (e.g. C<$x = 0.1; print "$x"+1> might
  print C<1>, and JSON::XS might output illegal JSON as JSON::XS relies on
  perl to stringify numbers).
  
  The solution is simple: don't call C<setlocale>, or use it for only those
  categories you need, such as C<LC_MESSAGES> or C<LC_CTYPE>.
  
  If you need C<LC_NUMERIC>, you should enable it only around the code that
  actually needs it (avoiding stringification of numbers), and restore it
  afterwards.
  
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  While the goal of this module is to be correct, that unfortunately does
  not mean it's bug-free, only that I think its design is bug-free. If you
  keep reporting bugs they will be fixed swiftly, though.
  
  Please refrain from using rt.cpan.org or any other bug reporting
  service. I put the contact address into my modules for a reason.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<List::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being
  individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<List::Util> does not export any subroutines.

  =head1 LIST-REDUCTION FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions all reduce a list down to a single value.
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 reduce
  
      $result = reduce { BLOCK } @list
  
  Reduces C<@list> by calling C<BLOCK> in a scalar context multiple times,
  setting C<$a> and C<$b> each time. The first call will be with C<$a> and C<$b>
  set to the first two elements of the list, subsequent calls will be done by
  setting C<$a> to the result of the previous call and C<$b> to the next element
  in the list.
  
  Returns the result of the last call to the C<BLOCK>. If C<@list> is empty then
  C<undef> is returned. If C<@list> only contains one element then that element
  is returned and C<BLOCK> is not executed.
  
  The following examples all demonstrate how C<reduce> could be used to implement
  the other list-reduction functions in this module. (They are not in fact
  implemented like this, but instead in a more efficient manner in individual C
  functions).
  
      $foo = reduce { defined($a)            ? $a :
                      $code->(local $_ = $b) ? $b :
                                               undef } undef, @list # first
  
      $foo = reduce { $a > $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # max
      $foo = reduce { $a gt $b ? $a : $b } 'A'..'Z'   # maxstr
      $foo = reduce { $a < $b ? $a : $b } 1..10       # min
      $foo = reduce { $a lt $b ? $a : $b } 'aa'..'zz' # minstr
      $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 1 .. 10               # sum
      $foo = reduce { $a . $b } @bar                  # concat
  
      $foo = reduce { $a || $code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar   # any
      $foo = reduce { $a && $code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar   # all
      $foo = reduce { $a && !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 1, @bar  # none
      $foo = reduce { $a || !$code->(local $_ = $b) } 0, @bar  # notall
         # Note that these implementations do not fully short-circuit
  
  If your algorithm requires that C<reduce> produce an identity value, then make
  sure that you always pass that identity value as the first argument to prevent
  C<undef> being returned
  
    $foo = reduce { $a + $b } 0, @values;             # sum with 0 identity value
  
  The above example code blocks also suggest how to use C<reduce> to build a
  more efficient combined version of one of these basic functions and a C<map>
  block. For example, to find the total length of the all the strings in a list,
  we could use
  
      $total = sum map { length } @strings;
  
  However, this produces a list of temporary integer values as long as the
  original list of strings, only to reduce it down to a single value again. We
  can compute the same result more efficiently by using C<reduce> with a code
  block that accumulates lengths by writing this instead as:
  
      $total = reduce { $a + length $b } 0, @strings
  
  The remaining list-reduction functions are all specialisations of this generic
  idea.
  
  =head2 any
  
      my $bool = any { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<any> returns true if any element makes the C<BLOCK>
  return a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty then
  it returns false.
  
  Many cases of using C<grep> in a conditional can be written using C<any>
  instead, as it can short-circuit after the first true result.
  
      if( any { length > 10 } @strings ) {
          # at least one string has more than 10 characters
      }
  
  =head2 all
  
      my $bool = all { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any>, except that it requires all elements of the C<@list> to
  make the C<BLOCK> return true. If any element returns false, then it returns
  false. If the C<BLOCK> never returns false or the C<@list> was empty then it
  returns true.
  
  =head2 none
  
  =head2 notall
  
      my $bool = none { BLOCK } @list;
  
      my $bool = notall { BLOCK } @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.33.>
  
  Similar to L</any> and L</all>, but with the return sense inverted. C<none>
  returns true only if no value in the C<@list> causes the C<BLOCK> to return
  true, and C<notall> returns true only if not all of the values do.
  
  =head2 first
  
      my $val = first { BLOCK } @list;
  
  Similar to C<grep> in that it evaluates C<BLOCK> setting C<$_> to each element
  of C<@list> in turn. C<first> returns the first element where the result from
  C<BLOCK> is a true value. If C<BLOCK> never returns true or C<@list> was empty
  then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = first { defined($_) } @list    # first defined value in @list
      $foo = first { $_ > $value } @list    # first value in @list which
                                            # is greater than $value
  
  =head2 max
  
      my $num = max @list;
  
  Returns the entry in the list with the highest numerical value. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = max 1..10                # 10
      $foo = max 3,9,12               # 12
      $foo = max @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 maxstr
  
      my $str = maxstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</max>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the highest string as defined by the C<gt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = maxstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'Z'
      $foo = maxstr "hello","world"   # "world"
      $foo = maxstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 min
  
      my $num = min @list;
  
  Similar to L</max> but returns the entry in the list with the lowest numerical
  value. If the list is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = min 1..10                # 1
      $foo = min 3,9,12               # 3
      $foo = min @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 minstr
  
      my $str = minstr @list;
  
  Similar to L</min>, but treats all the entries in the list as strings and
  returns the lowest string as defined by the C<lt> operator. If the list is
  empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = minstr 'A'..'Z'          # 'A'
      $foo = minstr "hello","world"   # "hello"
      $foo = minstr @bar, @baz        # whatever
  
  =head2 product
  
      my $num = product @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.35.>
  
  Returns the numerical product of all the elements in C<@list>. If C<@list> is
  empty then C<1> is returned.
  
      $foo = product 1..10            # 3628800
      $foo = product 3,9,12           # 324
  
  =head2 sum
  
      my $num_or_undef = sum @list;
  
  Returns the numerical sum of all the elements in C<@list>. For backwards
  compatibility, if C<@list> is empty then C<undef> is returned.
  
      $foo = sum 1..10                # 55
      $foo = sum 3,9,12               # 24
      $foo = sum @bar, @baz           # whatever
  
  =head2 sum0
  
      my $num = sum0 @list;
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  Similar to L</sum>, except this returns 0 when given an empty list, rather
  than C<undef>.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 KEY/VALUE PAIR LIST FUNCTIONS
  
  The following set of functions, all inspired by L<List::Pairwise>, consume an
  even-sized list of pairs. The pairs may be key/value associations from a hash,
  or just a list of values. The functions will all preserve the original ordering
  of the pairs, and will not be confused by multiple pairs having the same "key"
  value - nor even do they require that the first of each pair be a plain string.
  
  B<NOTE>: At the time of writing, the following C<pair*> functions that take a
  block do not modify the value of C<$_> within the block, and instead operate
  using the C<$a> and C<$b> globals instead. This has turned out to be a poor
  design, as it precludes the ability to provide a C<pairsort> function. Better
  would be to pass pair-like objects as 2-element array references in C<$_>, in
  a style similar to the return value of the C<pairs> function. At some future
  version this behaviour may be added.
  
  Until then, users are alerted B<NOT> to rely on the value of C<$_> remaining
  unmodified between the outside and the inside of the control block. In
  particular, the following example is B<UNSAFE>:
  
   my @kvlist = ...
  
   foreach (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $_ } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  Instead, write this using a lexical variable:
  
   foreach my $key (qw( some keys here )) {
      my @items = pairgrep { $a eq $key } @kvlist;
      ...
   }
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 pairs
  
      my @pairs = pairs @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of C<ARRAY> references, each containing two items from the
  given list. It is a more efficient version of
  
      @pairs = pairmap { [ $a, $b ] } @kvlist
  
  It is most convenient to use in a C<foreach> loop, for example:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my ( $key, $value ) = @$pair;
         ...
      }
  
  Since version C<1.39> these C<ARRAY> references are blessed objects,
  recognising the two methods C<key> and C<value>. The following code is
  equivalent:
  
      foreach my $pair ( pairs @kvlist ) {
         my $key   = $pair->key;
         my $value = $pair->value;
         ...
      }
  
  =head2 unpairs
  
      my @kvlist = unpairs @pairs
  
  I<Since version 1.42.>
  
  The inverse function to C<pairs>; this function takes a list of C<ARRAY>
  references containing two elements each, and returns a flattened list of the
  two values from each of the pairs, in order. This is notionally equivalent to
  
      my @kvlist = map { @{$_}[0,1] } @pairs
  
  except that it is implemented more efficiently internally. Specifically, for
  any input item it will extract exactly two values for the output list; using
  C<undef> if the input array references are short.
  
  Between C<pairs> and C<unpairs>, a higher-order list function can be used to
  operate on the pairs as single scalars; such as the following near-equivalents
  of the other C<pair*> higher-order functions:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs grep { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairgrep, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
      @kvlist = unpairs map { FUNC } pairs @kvlist
      # Like pairmap, but takes $_ instead of $a and $b
  
  Note however that these versions will not behave as nicely in scalar context.
  
  Finally, this technique can be used to implement a sort on a keyvalue pair
  list; e.g.:
  
      @kvlist = unpairs sort { $a->key cmp $b->key } pairs @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairkeys
  
      my @keys = pairkeys @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the first values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @keys = pairmap { $a } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairvalues
  
      my @values = pairvalues @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  A convenient shortcut to operating on even-sized lists of pairs, this function
  returns a list of the the second values of each of the pairs in the given list.
  It is a more efficient version of
  
      @values = pairmap { $b } @kvlist
  
  =head2 pairgrep
  
      my @kvlist = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairgrep { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<grep> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns an even-sized list of those pairs for which the C<BLOCK> returned true
  in list context, or the count of the B<number of pairs> in scalar context.
  (Note, therefore, in scalar context that it returns a number half the size of
  the count of items it would have returned in list context).
  
      @subset = pairgrep { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairgrep> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairfirst
  
      my ( $key, $val ) = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $found = pairfirst { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.30.>
  
  Similar to the L</first> function, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in scalar
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the first pair of values from the list for which the C<BLOCK> returned
  true in list context, or an empty list of no such pair was found. In scalar
  context it returns a simple boolean value, rather than either the key or the
  value found.
  
      ( $key, $value ) = pairfirst { $a =~ m/^[[:upper:]]+$/ } @kvlist
  
  As with C<grep> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairfirst> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  =head2 pairmap
  
      my @list = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
      my $count = pairmap { BLOCK } @kvlist;
  
  I<Since version 1.29.>
  
  Similar to perl's C<map> keyword, but interprets the given list as an
  even-sized list of pairs. It invokes the C<BLOCK> multiple times, in list
  context, with C<$a> and C<$b> set to successive pairs of values from the
  C<@kvlist>.
  
  Returns the concatenation of all the values returned by the C<BLOCK> in list
  context, or the count of the number of items that would have been returned in
  scalar context.
  
      @result = pairmap { "The key $a has value $b" } @kvlist
  
  As with C<map> aliasing C<$_> to list elements, C<pairmap> aliases C<$a> and
  C<$b> to elements of the given list. Any modifications of it by the code block
  will be visible to the caller.
  
  See L</KNOWN BUGS> for a known-bug with C<pairmap>, and a workaround.

  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =cut
  
  =head2 shuffle
  
      my @values = shuffle @values;
  
  Returns the values of the input in a random order
  
      @cards = shuffle 0..51      # 0..51 in a random order
  
  =head2 uniq
  
      my @subset = uniq @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  DWIM-ish string equality or C<undef> test. Preserves the order of unique
  elements, and retains the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniq @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  The C<undef> value is treated by this function as distinct from the empty
  string, and no warning will be produced. It is left as-is in the returned
  list. Subsequent C<undef> values are still considered identical to the first,
  and will be removed.
  
  =head2 uniqnum
  
      my @subset = uniqnum @values
  
  I<Since version 1.44.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  numerical equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains
  the first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqnum @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other numerical operations treat it; it
  compares equal to zero but additionally produces a warning if such warnings
  are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an C<undef> in
  the returned list is coerced into a numerical zero, so that the entire list of
  values returned by C<uniqnum> are well-behaved as numbers.
  
  =head2 uniqstr
  
      my @subset = uniqstr @values
  
  I<Since version 1.45.>
  
  Filters a list of values to remove subsequent duplicates, as judged by a
  string equality test. Preserves the order of unique elements, and retains the
  first value of any duplicate set.
  
      my $count = uniqstr @values
  
  In scalar context, returns the number of elements that would have been
  returned as a list.
  
  Note that C<undef> is treated much as other string operations treat it; it
  compares equal to the empty string but additionally produces a warning if such
  warnings are enabled (C<use warnings 'uninitialized';>). In addition, an
  C<undef> in the returned list is coerced into an empty string, so that the
  entire list of values returned by C<uniqstr> are well-behaved as strings.

  =head1 KNOWN BUGS
  
  =head2 RT #95409
  
  L<https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=95409>
  
  If the block of code given to L</pairmap> contains lexical variables that are
  captured by a returned closure, and the closure is executed after the block
  has been re-used for the next iteration, these lexicals will not see the
  correct values. For example:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      my $var = "$a is $b";
      sub { print "$var\n" };
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
   $_->() for @subs;
  
  Will incorrectly print
  
   three is 3
   three is 3
   three is 3
  
  This is due to the performance optimisation of using C<MULTICALL> for the code
  block, which means that fresh SVs do not get allocated for each call to the
  block. Instead, the same SV is re-assigned for each iteration, and all the
  closures will share the value seen on the final iteration.
  
  To work around this bug, surround the code with a second set of braces. This
  creates an inner block that defeats the C<MULTICALL> logic, and does get fresh
  SVs allocated each time:
  
   my @subs = pairmap {
      {
         my $var = "$a is $b";
         sub { print "$var\n"; }
      }
   } one => 1, two => 2, three => 3;
  
  This bug only affects closures that are generated by the block but used
  afterwards. Lexical variables that are only used during the lifetime of the
  block's execution will take their individual values for each invocation, as
  normal.
  
  =head2 uniqnum() on oversized bignums
  
  Due to the way that C<uniqnum()> compares numbers, it cannot distinguish
  differences between bignums (especially bigints) that are too large to fit in
  the native platform types. For example,
  
   my $x = Math::BigInt->new( "1" x 100 );
   my $y = $x + 1;
  
   say for uniqnum( $x, $y );
  
  Will print just the value of C<$x>, believing that C<$y> is a numerically-
  equivalent value. This bug does not affect C<uniqstr()>, which will correctly
  observe that the two values stringify to different strings.

  Scalar::Util - A selection of general-utility scalar subroutines
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Scalar::Util qw(blessed dualvar isdual readonly refaddr reftype
                          tainted weaken isweak isvstring looks_like_number
                          set_prototype);
                          # and other useful utils appearing below
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Scalar::Util> contains a selection of subroutines that people have expressed
  would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage would not really be high
  enough to warrant the use of a keyword, and the size would be so small that 
  being individual extensions would be wasteful.
  
  By default C<Scalar::Util> does not export any subroutines.
  
  =cut
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS FOR REFERENCES
  
  The following functions all perform some useful activity on reference values.
  
  =head2 blessed
  
      my $pkg = blessed( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a blessed reference, the name of the package that it is blessed
  into is returned. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $scalar = "foo";
      $class  = blessed $scalar;           # undef
  
      $ref    = [];
      $class  = blessed $ref;              # undef
  
      $obj    = bless [], "Foo";
      $class  = blessed $obj;              # "Foo"
  
  Take care when using this function simply as a truth test (such as in
  C<if(blessed $ref)...>) because the package name C<"0"> is defined yet false.
  
  =head2 refaddr
  
      my $addr = refaddr( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is reference, the internal memory address of the referenced value is
  returned as a plain integer. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $addr = refaddr "string";           # undef
      $addr = refaddr \$var;              # eg 12345678
      $addr = refaddr [];                 # eg 23456784
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $addr = refaddr $obj;               # eg 88123488
  
  =head2 reftype
  
      my $type = reftype( $ref );
  
  If C<$ref> is a reference, the basic Perl type of the variable referenced is
  returned as a plain string (such as C<ARRAY> or C<HASH>). Otherwise C<undef>
  is returned.
  
      $type = reftype "string";           # undef
      $type = reftype \$var;              # SCALAR
      $type = reftype [];                 # ARRAY
  
      $obj  = bless {}, "Foo";
      $type = reftype $obj;               # HASH
  
  =head2 weaken
  
      weaken( $ref );
  
  The lvalue C<$ref> will be turned into a weak reference. This means that it
  will not hold a reference count on the object it references. Also, when the
  reference count on that object reaches zero, the reference will be set to
  undef. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its argument and returns no
  value.
  
  This is useful for keeping copies of references, but you don't want to prevent
  the object being DESTROY-ed at its usual time.
  
      {
        my $var;
        $ref = \$var;
        weaken($ref);                     # Make $ref a weak reference
      }
      # $ref is now undef
  
  Note that if you take a copy of a scalar with a weakened reference, the copy
  will be a strong reference.
  
      my $var;
      my $foo = \$var;
      weaken($foo);                       # Make $foo a weak reference
      my $bar = $foo;                     # $bar is now a strong reference
  
  This may be less obvious in other situations, such as C<grep()>, for instance
  when grepping through a list of weakened references to objects that may have
  been destroyed already:
  
      @object = grep { defined } @object;
  
  This will indeed remove all references to destroyed objects, but the remaining
  references to objects will be strong, causing the remaining objects to never be
  destroyed because there is now always a strong reference to them in the @object
  array.
  
  =head2 unweaken
  
      unweaken( $ref );
  
  I<Since version 1.36.>
  
  The lvalue C<REF> will be turned from a weak reference back into a normal
  (strong) reference again. This function mutates the lvalue passed as its
  argument and returns no value. This undoes the action performed by
  L</weaken>.
  
  This function is slightly neater and more convenient than the
  otherwise-equivalent code
  
      my $tmp = $REF;
      undef $REF;
      $REF = $tmp;
  
  (because in particular, simply assigning a weak reference back to itself does
  not work to unweaken it; C<$REF = $REF> does not work).
  
  =head2 isweak
  
      my $weak = isweak( $ref );
  
  Returns true if C<$ref> is a weak reference.
  
      $ref  = \$foo;
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # false
      weaken($ref);
      $weak = isweak($ref);               # true
  
  B<NOTE>: Copying a weak reference creates a normal, strong, reference.
  
      $copy = $ref;
      $weak = isweak($copy);              # false
  
  =head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS
  
  =head2 dualvar
  
      my $var = dualvar( $num, $string );
  
  Returns a scalar that has the value C<$num> in a numeric context and the value
  C<$string> in a string context.
  
      $foo = dualvar 10, "Hello";
      $num = $foo + 2;                    # 12
      $str = $foo . " world";             # Hello world
  
  =head2 isdual
  
      my $dual = isdual( $var );
  
  I<Since version 1.26.>
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar that has both numeric and string values, the result is
  true.
  
      $foo = dualvar 86, "Nix";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that a scalar can be made to have both string and numeric content through
  numeric operations:
  
      $foo = "10";
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # false
      $bar = $foo + 0;
      $dual = isdual($foo);               # true
  
  Note that although C<$!> appears to be a dual-valued variable, it is
  actually implemented as a magical variable inside the interpreter:
  
      $! = 1;
      print("$!\n");                      # "Operation not permitted"
      $dual = isdual($!);                 # false
  
  You can capture its numeric and string content using:
  
      $err = dualvar $!, $!;
      $dual = isdual($err);               # true
  
  =head2 isvstring
  
      my $vstring = isvstring( $var );
  
  If C<$var> is a scalar which was coded as a vstring, the result is true.
  
      $vs   = v49.46.48;
      $fmt  = isvstring($vs) ? "%vd" : "%s"; #true
      printf($fmt,$vs);
  
  =head2 looks_like_number
  
      my $isnum = looks_like_number( $var );
  
  Returns true if perl thinks C<$var> is a number. See
  L<perlapi/looks_like_number>.
  
  =head2 openhandle
  
      my $fh = openhandle( $fh );
  
  Returns C<$fh> itself if C<$fh> may be used as a filehandle and is open, or is
  is a tied handle. Otherwise C<undef> is returned.
  
      $fh = openhandle(*STDIN);           # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(\*STDIN);          # \*STDIN
      $fh = openhandle(*NOTOPEN);         # undef
      $fh = openhandle("scalar");         # undef
  
  =head2 readonly
  
      my $ro = readonly( $var );
  
  Returns true if C<$var> is readonly.
  
      sub foo { readonly($_[0]) }
  
      $readonly = foo($bar);              # false
      $readonly = foo(0);                 # true
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype( $code, $prototype );
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
      set_prototype \&foo, '$$';
  
  =head2 tainted
  
      my $t = tainted( $var );
  
  Return true if C<$var> is tainted.
  
      $taint = tainted("constant");       # false
      $taint = tainted($ENV{PWD});        # true if running under -T

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<Sub::Util> contains a selection of utility subroutines that are useful for
  operating on subs and CODE references.
  
  The rationale for inclusion in this module is that the function performs some
  work for which an XS implementation is essential because it cannot be
  implemented in Pure Perl, and which is sufficiently-widely used across CPAN
  that its popularity warrants inclusion in a core module, which this is.

  =head2 prototype
  
      my $proto = prototype( $code )
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Returns the prototype of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one, as a
  string. This is the same as the C<CORE::prototype> operator; it is included
  here simply for symmetry and completeness with the other functions.
  
  =cut
  
  sub prototype

  }
  
  =head2 set_prototype
  
      my $code = set_prototype $prototype, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the prototype of the function given by the C<$code> reference, or deletes
  it if C<$prototype> is C<undef>. Returns the C<$code> reference itself.
  
  I<Caution>: This function takes arguments in a different order to the previous
  copy of the code from C<Scalar::Util>. This is to match the order of
  C<set_subname>, and other potential additions in this file. This order has
  been chosen as it allows a neat and simple chaining of other
  C<Sub::Util::set_*> functions as might become available, such as:
  
   my $code =
      set_subname   name_here =>
      set_prototype '&@'      =>

  Returns the name of the given C<$code> reference, if it has one. Normal named
  subs will give a fully-qualified name consisting of the package and the
  localname separated by C<::>. Anonymous code references will give C<__ANON__>
  as the localname. If a name has been set using L</set_subname>, this name will
  be returned instead.
  
  This function was inspired by C<sub_fullname> from L<Sub::Identify>. The
  remaining functions that C<Sub::Identify> implements can easily be emulated
  using regexp operations, such as
  
   sub get_code_info { return (subname $_[0]) =~ m/^(.+)::(.+?)$/ }
   sub sub_name      { return (get_code_info $_[0])[0] }
   sub stash_name    { return (get_code_info $_[0])[1] }
  
  I<Users of Sub::Name beware>: This function is B<not> the same as
  C<Sub::Name::subname>; it returns the existing name of the sub rather than
  changing it. To set or change a name, see instead L</set_subname>.

      my $code = set_subname $name, $code;
  
  I<Since version 1.40.>
  
  Sets the name of the function given by the C<$code> reference. Returns the
  C<$code> reference itself. If the C<$name> is unqualified, the package of the
  caller is used to qualify it.
  
  This is useful for applying names to anonymous CODE references so that stack
  traces and similar situations, to give a useful name rather than having the
  default of C<__ANON__>. Note that this name is only used for this situation;
  the C<set_subname> will not install it into the symbol table; you will have to
  do that yourself if required.
  
  However, since the name is not used by perl except as the return value of
  C<caller>, for stack traces or similar, there is no actual requirement that
  the name be syntactically valid as a perl function name. This could be used to
  attach extra information that could be useful in debugging stack traces.
  
  This function was copied from C<Sub::Name::subname> and renamed to the naming
  convention of this module.

=head1 NAME

dist_surveyor - determine exactly what dist versions are installed

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dist_surveyor [options] /some/perl/lib/dir

Typically a perl library directory will have an architecture specific library
as a subdirectory. The dist_surveyor script will detect and add it automatically
if the perl being used has the same 'archname' the same as the one in the library.
If not, then specify the "archlib" directory explicitly I<first>:

  dist_surveyor [options] /some/perl/lib/dir/archname /some/perl/lib/dir

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This utility examines all the modules installed within the specified perl
library directory and uses the metacpan API to work out what versions of what
distributions could have provided those modules. It then works out which of
those candidate distributions is the most likely one.

It is fairly robust and copes well with edge cases like installation of
non-released versions from git repos and local modifications.

Distributions are written to stdout. Progress and issues are reported to stderr.

It can take a long time to run for the first time on a directory with a
large number of modules and candidate distributions.  The data fetched from
metacpan is cached so future runs are much faster.  (The system this code was
tested on took about 60 minutes to process around 500 distributions with no
cached data, and under 10 minutes for later runs that could reuse the cached
data. The cache file ended up about 40MB in size.)

=head1 Fatpacked script

A fatpacked version of this script exists in:
L<https://raw.github.com/semuel/Dist-Surveyor/master/dist_surveyor_packed.pl>

Please note that the packed version expect that the following modules already
installed on the local system: L<Data::Dumper>, L<Carp> and L<LWP>. Also,
if you are planing to --makecpan, you also need L<Compress::Zlib>

=head1 OPTIONS

    --verbose    Show more detailed progress

    --debug      Show much more information

    --match R    Ignore modules that don't match regex R (unanchored)

    --perlver V  Ignore modules that are shipped with perl version V

    --remnants   Include old distribution versions that have left old modules behind

    --uncached   Don't use or update the persistent cache

    --makecpan D Create a CPAN repository in directory D

    --output S   List of field names to output, separate by spaces.
                 
    --format S   Printf format string with a %s for each field in --output

=head2 --makecpan

Creates a CPAN repository in the specified directory by fetching the selected
distributions into authors/id/... and writing the index files into modules/...

If the directory already exists then selected distributions that already exist
are not refetched, any distributions that already exist but aren't selected by
this run are left in place.

New package distribution information is merged into the modules/02packages index file.

Some additional files are written into a dist_surveyor subdirectory:

=head3 dist_surveyor/token_packages.txt

This file lists one unique 'token package' per distribution. It's very useful
to speed up re-running a full install after some distributions have failed.

=head1 SURVEY USAGE

Run a survey and create a mini-CPAN repository containing the distributions:

    dist_surveyor --makecpan my_cpan /some/perl/lib/dir > installed_dists.txt

It's important to give the correct perl lib directory path.

It's important to check the results related to any modules that generated
warnings during the run.

=head1 INSTALLATION USAGE

Then, to install those distributions into a new library:

    cpanm --mirror file:$PWD/my_cpan --mirror-only [-l new_lib] < installed_dists.txt

It's very likely that some distributions will fail tests and not install,
which will, in turn, cause others to fail. Once the initial run is complete
study the cpam build log file carefully and resolve the test failures.

Running cpanm with a list of distributions, as above, will always reinstall
I<all> the listed distributions. Even those already sucessfully installed.

It's much (I<much>) faster to give cpanm a list of package names as that allows
it to skip those that it knows are already installed. The L</--makecpan> option
writes a list of 'token packages', one per distribution, so you can use that
with cpanm:

    cpanm --mirror file:$PWD/my_cpan --mirror-only [-l new_lib] < my_cpan/dist_surveyor/token_packages.txt

When a distro fails tests I use the cpanm C<--look> option to investigate:

    cpanm --mirror file:$PWD/my_cpan --mirror-only --look Some::Package

I'll often end up building, testing and installing the distro from within that
cpanm look shell. Once installed I'll rerun cpanm using the full C<token_packages.txt>
file again. If there are more failures I'll repeat that sequence till they're all resolved.

=head1 BUGS

Probably.

=head1 TODO

    * Auto-detect when directory given isn't the root of a perl library dir tree.
        E.g. by matching file names to module names

    * Add support for matching Foo.pm.PL files (e.g. FCGI and common::sense)

    * For installed modules get the file modification time (last commit time)
        and use it to eliminate candidate dists that were released after that time.

    * Consider factoring in release status ('authorized') so rogue releases
        that ship copies of many other modules (like Net-Braintree-0.1.1)
        are given a lower priority.

    * Sort out ExtUtils::Perllocal::Parser situation
        Avoid hard-coded %distro_key_mod_names related to perllocal.pod where the
        dist name doesn't match the key module name.
        Or maybe just remove use of distro_key_mod_names and perllocal entirely?

    * Optimise use of metacpan. Check caching. Use ElasticSearch.pm.

    * Fully handle merging of pre-existing --makecpan directory data files.

    * Consider factoring install date in the output ordering. May help with edge cases
        where a package P is installed via distros A then B. If A is reinstalled after B
        then the reinstalled P will be from A but should be from B. (I don't know of any
        cases, but it's certainly a possibility. The LWP breakup and Class::MOP spring to
        mind as possible candidates.)
